      <link>https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/editorial/import-of-rice-alone-cant-stabilise-market</link>
      <description>Bangladesh's drive to build a substantial stock of rice to meet any contingency appears, on the face of it, to be quite logical.

      <link>https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/interviews/news/factory-owners-fear-labour-unions-stems-their-loss-control-4038211</link>
      <description>Before I offer my perspective, it is important to first clarify where responsibility lies. The factory owners themselves are entirely responsible for the situation they now call harmful to the industry. For all the things involved, there is no one else to blame—not the workers, not the labour leaders, not the government, not any international organisation.</description>

      <description>Access to clean public toilets is not only a basic human right, it also draws a distinction between a life of dignity versus one of humiliation. With the way most public toilets in this country are maintained, it is difficult for anyone to feel human using them.</description>

      <description>It is most unfortunate that across Bangladesh, persons with disabilities, especially women and girls, continue to face various forms of discrimination that deny them basic rights, dignity, and opportunities. Despite laws, international commitments, and years of advocacy, people with disabilities still struggle to access education, healthcare, employment, and public spaces.</description>

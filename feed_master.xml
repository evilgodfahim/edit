      <title>Why playing India is the smartest decision PCB has made in months. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972538/why-playing-india-is-the-smartest-decision-pcb-has-made-in-months</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In international cricket, principle is often loud, emotional and instantly gratifying. Strategy, on the other hand, is quieter, slower, and frequently misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;eventually agree to play India &lt;/a&gt;on February 15 falls squarely in the latter category, and despite the initial optics, it is the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic boycott call did what it needed to do early on. It created noise, unsettled the International Cricket Council (ICC), and earned Pakistan something it has been desperately short of in recent years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970749&quot;&gt;an ally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s open friction with the ICC and India over security, scheduling and governance issues suddenly aligned its interests with Pakistan’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials taking place in Lahore on Feb 8, 2026. &amp;mdash; Screengrab via PCB video&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/1116263346e940a.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials taking place in Lahore on Feb 8, 2026. — Screengrab via PCB video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alignment may be situational for now, but in a cricketing ecosystem where Pakistan often finds itself isolated, even a temporary ally matters. In what seemed like an emotional and loud drama initially, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has done something that suggests calculation rather than impulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s stance carried weight morally as it played its strongest card not for immediate self-benefit, but in visible solidarity with another board, one with far less financial leverage and political capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode also forced a conversation about power imbalance in world cricket and structural marginalisation of smaller boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match. It is a financial event, the economic engine that quietly funds the ICC&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/11163031a88a82b.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;standing with Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan positioned itself not as a lone dissenter, but as part of a broader discomfort within the “middle tier” of cricket nations. However, the PCB has bills to pay, and such symbolic gestures, regardless of their strength, are not going to balance the books, which is why deciding to play the India game is a strategic win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking the field on Sunday, Pakistan will avoid the twin disasters a boycott would have triggered: forfeiture of crucial match points and loss of ICC revenue. The former would not have hurt Pakistan competitively as much, given their record against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 times the two arch-rivals have faced each other in the shortest format, Pakistan have only won three, while India dominates with 13 victories. Instead, it was the huge potential loss of money that got the governing body quiver at Pakistan’s boycott call.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match. It is a financial event, the economic engine that quietly funds the ICC’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India receives 38.5 per cent of the ICC’s revenue distribution in the current cycle, which is more than what the next six boards receive combined. Pakistan’s share hovers around five to six per cent. This disparity is not an accident; it reflects market gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian broadcast market alone drives the bulk of ICC media rights, a deal worth billions over a four-year cycle, which is the major source of revenue for the governing body.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite receiving the lion’s share, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)’s income doesn’t depend on the ICC, as its revenue is heavily dominated by the Indian Premier League (IPL) and bilateral series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, any financial loss to the ICC would not have impacted BCCI as strongly as it would have Pakistan and other cricket boards, whose incomes are heavily dependent on their ICC revenue share.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason India-Pakistan contests are manufactured into every ICC tournament. They are the biggest television events in cricket, reportedly accounting for 20-30pc of a tournament’s total broadcast value in a single match. The marquee encounter does not fund India’s cricket at a large scale, but it subsidises the ecosystem in which Pakistan cricket survives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To risk that revenue for a dispute that was not even Pakistan’s own would have been strategically naive. Agreeing to play India also repairs and strengthens the PCB’s working relationship with other boards, particularly Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/in-phone-call-with-pm-sri-lanka-president-urges-pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india&quot;&gt;strongly requested&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to call off its boycott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are boards that Pakistan has often relied on for neutral venues, logistical cooperation and political support within ICC committees. A unilateral boycott would have made Pakistan appear rigid, pushing it further to the margins at a time when it needs quiet diplomacy, not loud isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, even the ICC has been accommodating towards the PCB, bending significantly by agreeing to a hybrid hosting model to ensure that Pakistan does not have to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing the governing body further, especially when Pakistan lacks the financial muscle to challenge it head-on, would have been a dangerous escalation. The larger context is bleak, as the ICC is effectively run by India. This is not a conspiracy, but an economic reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s billion-plus market dictates broadcast value, sponsorship interest and administrative power. Complaining about reality without a long-term counter strategy is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While boycotts feel defiant, the harsh reality is that they change nothing. Pakistan currently does not possess the commercial influence or on-field dominance required to force systemic change. That does not mean it should abandon principle altogether, but it must choose its battles wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By taking a firm stance and then agreeing to play, the PCB has extracted narrative value without incurring material loss. It has shown that it can push back, but also that it understands its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sport that is increasingly governed by realpolitik, that balance matters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rawalpindi secures pacer Naseem Shah for Rs86.5m as bidding on fast bowlers concludes at PSL 11 auction in Lahore. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972508/rawalpindi-secures-pacer-naseem-shah-for-rs865m-as-bidding-on-fast-bowlers-concludes-at-psl-11-auction-in-lahore</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is underway in Lahore, with fast bowler Naseem Shah sold to Rawalpindi for Rs86.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight franchises have started bidding on spinners, following the conclusion of the previous round, which saw wicket-keepers being auctioned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi spinner Rishaad Hossain was sold to Rawalpindi for a bid of Rs30m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up were Mamoon Imtiaz, Ali Majid, Momin Qamar, Peter Hatzoglou, and Arif Yaqoob, who did not receive any bids. Faisal Akram was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for the final bid of Rs12.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#sahibaza-farhan-sold-off-to-sialkot-stallionz&quot; id=&quot;sahibaza-farhan-sold-off-to-sialkot-stallionz&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sahibaza Farhan sold off to Sialkot Stallionz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bidding on wicket keepers began with Azam Khan — at the base price of Rs11m. With the final bids of Rs31.5m by Sialkot Stallionz and Rs32.5m by Karachi Kings, the latter managed to secure Khan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sialkot Stallionz bagged Sahibzada Farhan against Karachi Kings, with a bid of Rs57m.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up were Sri Lankan cricketer Dinesh Chandimal and West Indies’ Johnson Charles, both of whom went unsold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the bidding for fast bowlers, Muhammad Ali was sold off to Hyderabad Houstan Kingsmen in a last-minute bid of Rs21.5m against Rawalpindi’s Rs20.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Chris Jordan, who went unsold after receiving zero bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lahore Qalandars regained fast-bowler Haris Rauf at Rs76m against the Rawalpindi team’s Rs74.5m bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Hasnain, at the base price of  received no bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karachi Kings put in the first bid for Naseem Shah at Rs65m, followed by Islamabad United bidding Rs66.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a series of back-and-forth bids between the two, Rawalpindi came in at a bid of Rs86.5m, following which Karachi Kings bowed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second round began with Barbadian cricketer Kyle Mayers at the base price of Rs11m, who went unsold after no bids were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand’s Colin Munroe went unsold as well. Karachi Kings bagged Australian batsman David Warner at Rs79m after a round of back-and-forth bidding with Peshawar Zalmi.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African batsman Rilee Rossouw was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for Rs55m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs11m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-rounders Hussain Talat, Asif Afridi, Danish Aziz, and Muhammad Zeeshan at the base price of Rs11m received no bids as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bidding on batsmen underway at Pakistan Super League 11 auction Lahore. [ dawn ]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is currently underway in Lahore, with the eight franchises bidding on batsmen following the conclusion of the first round, which saw all-rounders auctioned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second round began with Barbadian cricketer Kyle Mayers at the base price of Rs1.1m, who went unsold after no bids were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand’s Colin Munroe went unsold as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#islamabad-united-bags-all-rounder-faheem-ashraf&quot; id=&quot;islamabad-united-bags-all-rounder-faheem-ashraf&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamabad United bags all-rounder Faheem Ashraf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs1.1m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-rounders Hussain Talat, Asif Afridi, Danish Aziz, and Muhammad Zeeshan at the base price of Rs1.1m received no bids as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian cricketer Abhishek Sharma hospitalised ahead of T20 World Cup game with Namibia. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972514/indian-cricketer-abhishek-sharma-hospitalised-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-game-with-namibia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prolific Indian opener Abhishek Sharma has been hospitalised with an upset stomach ahead of the group match against Namibia at the T20 World Cup, a cricket board official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive left-hander is key to India’s chances of defending their title at the 20-team tournament and is doubtful for the Group A fixture on Thursday in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old was admitted to a Delhi hospital on Tuesday after he missed training with a stomach issue he carried from the opener in Mumbai, the official told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate acknowledged the concern on Tuesday, saying the batsman had “still got a few issues with his tummy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope that he’ll be available for the game in a few days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhishek was out for a duck in India’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971699/suryakumars-unbeaten-84-rescues-india-against-usa-in-t20-world-cup&quot;&gt;win over the United States&lt;/a&gt; but has been a strong performer in the lead-up to the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; arch-rivals Pakistan in a blockbuster on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Pakistani government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it was withdrawing its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decision to boycott&lt;/a&gt; the match with India, which had been taken previously in the wake of Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to tour India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to move forward with the much-anticipated game came after protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;negotiations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the ICC and the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consultations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders, and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>US trade office removes controversial map of India from social media after Pakistan protests. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972510/us-trade-office-removes-controversial-map-of-india-from-social-media-after-pakistan-protests</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map, which accompanied a USTR press release announcing a framework for an interim US-India trade agreement, showed the entire Jammu and Kashmir region — including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan — within Indian boundaries. It also depicted China’s Aksai Chin region as part of India, despite the fact that the area is claimed by China and remains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1772898&quot;&gt;disputed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971369&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970640&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227&quot;&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh's recent trade agreement with the United States appears to be a double-edged sword for its garment industry. Although it provides zero-duty access, the stipulation to use US-sourced cotton and fibers undermines their competitive edge, given their current dependence on alternative suppliers. Additionally, the obligation to import US agricultural products and energy adds financial strain.</description>

      <title>Bangladeshi woman moves Lahore High Court against ‘unjustified’ offloading by FIA. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972401/bangladeshi-woman-moves-lahore-high-court-against-unjustified-offloading-by-fia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: An elderly woman, who was allegedly born in Bangladesh and was trafficked and sold in Pakistan some 35 years ago, has approached the Lahore High Court against the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for offloading her from a Dhaka-bound flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Razia Bibi, 58, filed a petition through her counsel, Ali Changezi Sandhu, and also sought imposition of a fine on the FIA for offloading her, allegedly without any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the petition, the counsel alleged that the petitioner was kidnapped in Bangladesh and illegally brought to Pakistan, where she was sold in Karachi some 35 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner was forced into marriage with her ‘purchaser’ in Pakistan and later shifted to Kasur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the petitioner, who is now a Pakistani citizen, recently reconnected with her Bangladeshi family through social media and her mother pleaded to meet her one last time in her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer stated when the petitioner, on Feb 27, 2025, reached the Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore, to travel to Bangladesh, the FIA immigration staff offloaded her without providing any justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner filed an application with the interior ministry for action against the “unlawful” act of the FIA officials, but to no avail so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argued that on the basis of mere suspicion and assumptions regarding illegal travel and human smuggling, thousands of Pakistani youths had been falling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961655&quot;&gt;victim&lt;/a&gt; to the FIA’s “unlawful offloading”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, offloading an elderly woman without any reason clearly indicates that the FIA engages in illegal practices, the counsel alleged, and sought an order for the agency to compensate the petitioner for the amount she spent on her air ticket and visa fee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sensible decision. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972476/sensible-decision</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER days-long negotiations, Pakistan moved for the greater good of world cricket when its government gave the national cricket team the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;go-ahead&lt;/a&gt; to play their Twenty20 World Cup match against India on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play the blockbuster fixture, which is the revenue generator for the International Cricket Council, after Scotland had been drafted in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh at the World Cup following the latter country’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for their matches due to security concerns. The Pakistan Cricket Board had protested the decision of the India-led ICC. While the team was allowed to travel to the tournament it was instructed to forfeit the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its finances in danger, the ICC came to the table with its director Imran Khawaja flying to Pakistan over the weekend. Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Aminul Islam also arrived, with Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi at the centre of negotiations. Pakistan had already been requested by Sri Lanka, where the national team is playing their matches of the World Cup, and the UAE to reconsider their decision. The PCB, however, was fighting a bigger battle: to ensure equality in world cricket against the governing body that has for long acted on India’s whims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, it has succeeded. The ICC has not penalised Bangladesh, while also granting it hosting rights for a tournament in the 2028-2031 cycle to mitigate the impact from its ouster from the World Cup. It therefore made sense for Pakistan to change their stance; going ahead with the World Cup match against India means ensuring financial security for the cricket world, especially the associate members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should not be forgotten. It should also mark the start of a new era in cricket governance. The politicisation of the sport has been a menace that has hindered the growth of the game for long. Sports should not be used as a propagation of political messaging and it is high time this practice was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the arrangement between Pakistan and India, which sees both sides play their matches of an event in either country at neutral venues, ends, the ICC should look to ensuring that it normalises bilateral cricketing ties between the two arch-rivals. That would embellish the ICC’s legitimacy as a neutral body that is focused on making sure that the game stays above petty politicking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>India need not be concerned about the new trade agreement between Bangladesh and the United States. Former Indian envoy Veena Sikri states Bangladesh cannot afford the promised Boeing jet purchases. She also notes that Bangladesh's access to US markets is tied to sourcing materials like yarn and cotton from the USA. India already supplies these competitively and quickly.</description>

      <title>Over 150,000 cops to guard ‘risky’ polling stations in Bangladesh. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972439/over-150000-cops-to-guard-risky-polling-stations-in-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s police chief said on Tuesday that more than 150,000 officers will be deployed for this week’s elections, warning that more than half of polling stations were flagged as vulnerable to violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that five people were killed and more than 600 injured in political clashes during the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972185&quot;&gt; campaign&lt;/a&gt; period from Dec 11 to Feb 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 157,000 police officers, backed by 100,000 soldiers and other security forces, will guard Thursday’s vote — the first since a mass uprising toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are 1,000 per cent confident about doing our part,” Inspector General of Police Baharul Alam told reporters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman warns of ‘huge’ challenges ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country of 170 million has remained in political turmoil since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; against Hasina, when police carried out a deadly crackdown during her failed bid to cling to power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alam said police had assessed that “more than 24,000 polling centres have been marked as either high-risk or moderately risky” for possible unrest, violence or ballot stuffing — more than half of the 42,000 centres nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The location of some centres is very remote, and there is intense competition, and hostility among candidates and their supporters,” he said, adding that 1,300 police guns looted during the 2024 unrest have still not been recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In high-risk and moderately risky centres, police will carry out patrol duty with body-worn cameras for the first time,” Alam said. He added that police were determined to ensure the polls were peaceful, but said he accepted that distrust of his force remained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is quite understandable why people do not trust the police,” he said, adding: “Over the last 15 ye­­a­rs, based on what we have delivered — in fact, for the last 150 years, our predecessors mostly beat people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bangla­de­sh’s leading prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman said on Tuesday he faces “huge” challenges if he wins elections this week, vowing to repair a country he said was looted under the previous ousted government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to ensure a normal situation in the country, so that people are safe,” Rahman told &lt;em&gt;AFP.&lt;/em&gt; But he warned the task ahead would be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EU parliament adopts twin texts hardening migration policy. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972438/eu-parliament-adopts-twin-texts-hardening-migration-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRASBOURG: The European Parliament on Tuesday definitively adopted two flagship texts tightening EU migration policy, championed by an alliance of right-wing and far-right lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is seeking to make it easier for its 27 member states to send asylum seekers to countries they did not come from but that Europe deems “safe”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has sought to test the concept with centres in Albania. The migrant centres have, however, largely stood empty since being opened in 2024 because of legal challenges, with many Italian judges viewing the scheme as unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the EU measures adopted on Tuesday is expected to facilitate this approach, to the dismay of human rights advocates and left-wing groups, who warn about the treatment asylum seekers may face in such countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green MEP Melissa Camara called it “another step in the dehumanisation of the European Union’s migration policy,” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;charging that the dignity of asylum seekers was being “trampled” on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission rejects the criticism, insisting that any country receiving migrants under the scheme must respect fundamental rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key measure approved by parliament is the creation of a list of countries the EU considers “safe” — effectively limiting asylum prospects for their nationals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list, which includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia, is intended to speed up the processing of asylum claims and, where appropriate, accelerate returns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Citizens expect us to deliver on our promises regarding migration policy, and that is exactly what we are doing today,” conservative lawmaker Lena Dupont told the assembly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s political centre of gravity has shifted firmly right in recent years, and a decline in irregular entries — down around 25 per cent in 2025 compared to 2024 — has not eased the political pressure to act on the hot-button issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly one million people applied for asylum in the EU last year and about 440,000 were granted protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PAF’s participation in Saudi defence expo reinforces Pakistan’s position as ‘emerging hub of aerospace innovation’. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972255/pafs-participation-in-saudi-defence-expo-reinforces-pakistans-position-as-emerging-hub-of-aerospace-innovation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;JF-17&lt;/a&gt; Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967005&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024. Azerbaijan had become the third country to acquire JF-17 fighters after Myanmar and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COAS Munir lauds ‘character, courage, competence’ shown by soldiers in ongoing fight against terrorism. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972253/coas-munir-lauds-character-courage-competence-shown-by-soldiers-in-ongoing-fight-against-terrorism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded the “character, courage, and competence” demonstrated by soldiers in the ongoing fight against terrorism, the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an ISPR &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7615&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the CDF made these remarks while addressing the closing ceremony of the 9th International Pakistan Army Team Spirit (PATS) Competition as the chief guest on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming the core values of the army, the CDF “underscored the enduring soldierly attributes of ‘character, courage and competence’, which have been consistently demonstrated by Pakistani soldiers, particularly in the ongoing fight against terrorism”, the military’s media wing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field Marshal Munir also “commended all participating teams for their exceptional professionalism, physical and mental endurance, operational competence and high morale displayed during the exercise”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He emphasised the importance of such multinational engagements in enhancing collective preparedness and adapting to the evolving character of modern warfare,” the press release added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISPR described PATS Competition as a 60-hour-long patrolling exercise, designed to “enhance professional military skills through the exchange of innovative ideas, tactical experiences and best practices among participating teams”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise, held from February 5 to 9, was carried out in the semi-mountainous terrain of Punjab, “providing a realistic and challenging operational environment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the years, PATS has evolved into a prestigious and highly competitive military exercise, recognised for promoting professional excellence and mutual learning among participating nations,” the statement noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affirmed that the forum “continues to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and understanding, while fostering camaraderie and team spirit in a demanding operational setting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s PATS Competition featured 19 countries — including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, the United States of America, and Uzbekistan — while Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand attended the exercise as observers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 16 domestic teams from the army and the navy, along with observers from the air force, also participated in the event, ISPR stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDF also presented awards to the outstanding participants of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“International observers and defence attachés from participating countries also attended the event and expressed appreciation for high standard of professionalism, organisation, and conduct demonstrated throughout the exercise,” the press release read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the CDF also witnessed miscellaneous training activities at the National Counter Terrorism Centre in Pabbi, including a visit to the newly established Tactical Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lauded the efforts of troops and the technical team and emphasised the importance of simulator-based training to complement traditional training methods, ISPR said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh poll race heats up on final day of campaigning. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972185/bangladesh-poll-race-heats-up-on-final-day-of-campaigning</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Tens of thousands of supporters attend rival rallies across Dhaka&lt;br /&gt;• Voters will elect lawmakers to a 350-seat parliament&lt;br /&gt;• BNP, led by Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique, widely seen as a frontrunner&lt;br /&gt;• BNP’s main rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Shafiqur Rahman, allied with the student-led National Citizen Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat parliament, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — led by Tarique Rahman, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; in December after 17 years in exile — widely tipped as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s key rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party that is led by Shafiqur Rahman and has allied with the National Citizen Party (NCP) that was formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Justice’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Long live the revolution’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 10 - China’s influence in Bangladesh, boosted by the 2024 ouster of New Delhi‑aligned leader Sheikh Hasina, is likely to deepen after this week's election, although politicians and analysts say India is too large a neighbour to be sidelined completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PSL franchise Multan Sultans sold for record Rs2.45bn; new owner says name will be changed to Rawalpindi. [ dawn ]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Super League franchise (PSL) Multan Sultans on Monday was sold to Walee Technologies for a record Rs2.45 billion ahead of the tournament’s 11th edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the auction in Lahore, show host Fakhr-i-Alam informed bidders that the winning bid would also cover the annual fee to maintain ownership of the team for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MultanSultans/status/2020864897551106059&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the auction ceremony, the new owner of the team announced that they would be changing the name to Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you ready for a surprise? We will be going for Rawalpindi!” announced the company’s chief executive officer, Ahsan Tahir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the ceremony, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated Walee Technologies on their successful bid and expressed gratitude to former board chairman Najam Sethi for his vision for the Multan Sultans franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This Multan Sultans was created by Najam Sethi &lt;em&gt;sahib&lt;/em&gt; and the person who started this journey; we are so pleased he is with us today,” Naqvi said, inviting Sethi onto the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Sethi said, “I’m obviously delighted to be here; this is the culmination of a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m obviously over the moon that it’s come through under Mohsin Naqvi, who is a dear, dear friend of mine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sethi hailed the winning bid as a “great moment for Pakistan cricket”, adding that Naqvi would give good news “beyond PSL” over the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, at a press conference with representatives from Walee Technologies, Naqvi said that the future of the Multan Sultans brand would have to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot ask the person paying Rs2.45bn to keep the name Multan Sultans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we discussed auctioning Multan Sultans, we planned to keep it for one or two years. But there was a good environment in the market and we were already auctioning five or six teams,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB chief noted that there were concerns, given the brand’s age and the possibility of damage to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, Multan Sultans is very close to my heart, so we will come up with a solution,” Naqvi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about the criteria for setting the opening bid at Rs1.82bn, he replied that it was the second-highest bid for the Sialkot team, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965821&quot;&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; for Rs1.85bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a question about ongoing meetings with a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pakistan’s boycott of the match with India in the T20 World Cup, Naqvi replied, “The issue was Bangladesh’s. We did not want to let their point of view go; they are our brothers and you saw the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things are happening, which is why I won’t say much, but the ICC and the Bangladesh board are in that phase where if I say anything, it won’t be right. We’ll update you once we receive information,” the PCB chief said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said that “guests need to be respected” when asked about the attitude of the visiting ICC delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walee Technologies is a global company specialising in projects in the media, finance and technology sectors, according to their &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://walee.pk/about-walee/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which added that the company had also earlier acquired PSL livestreaming rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise, started in 2017 under the name Multan Sultans, competed in eight consecutive editions of the PSL, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1631329&quot;&gt;winning &lt;/a&gt;the league in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, the franchise was left &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957302&quot;&gt;ownerless &lt;/a&gt;after the PCB did not extend a renewal offer to owner Ali Khan Tareen. The PCB then announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963738&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;take over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the franchise for the upcoming tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bids were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966930&quot;&gt;invited &lt;/a&gt;on January 14 and their technical evaluation was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970696&quot;&gt;completed &lt;/a&gt;by February 3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scotland spoil Italy’s T20 World Cup debut with big win. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972064/scotland-spoil-italys-t20-world-cup-debut-with-big-win</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;T20 World Cup debutants Italy had a bruising introduction to cricket’s biggest stage as they suffered a crushing 73-run loss to Scotland on Monday in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland piled up 207-4 with opener George Munsey top-scoring with 84 and in reply, Italy were bowled out for 134 in 16.4 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-spinner Michael Leask took 4-17 for Scotland, adding to his batting cameo of an unbeaten 22 off five balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation better known for its football, Italy are the lowest-ranked side in the 20-team tournament and were making a slice of history here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing a mammoth 208 for victory, they suffered early blows before a valiant fourth-wicket partnership of 73 between Australia-born brothers Ben and Harry Manenti kept them afloat at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020782307871965359&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Harry departed for 37 and Ben got out after his 31-ball 52 as the Italian batting collapsed from 113-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully we’ll sit down at some stage and reflect on that little partnership that we had and it would have been nice to contribute to a win there,” said vice-captain Harry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called playing with his brother “special”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously growing up and playing backyard cricket with him, batting together, and as young kids then dreaming of being at a World Cup batting together and we’ve got to live that out today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa-born captain Wayne Madsen could not bat after he dislocated his shoulder while fielding and might miss the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland skipper Richie Berrington said it was vital for them to bounce back after losing their opening match of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really pleased to get our first win. In the end it was a comprehensive win, but we had to work hard for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland originally failed to qualify for the World Cup but with only two weeks to go, they replaced Bangladesh, who were kicked out after they refused to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#madsen-heartbreak&quot; id=&quot;madsen-heartbreak&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Madsen heartbreak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy won the toss and bowled in the Group C encounter, where there were a few Italian fans decked out in the country’s blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rode on a 126-run opening stand between Munsey and Michael Jones, who hit 37, to post the highest total in the tournament so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon McMullen with an unbeaten 18-ball 41 and Leask, who hit two fours and two sixes in the last five balls, took Scotland to their best T20 World Cup total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Munsey started briskly with a flurry of fours to unsettle Italy’s attack in the first six overs of the powerplay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy suffered a blow when Madsen fell awkwardly while trying to stop a boundary in the fourth over and went off the field wincing in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shoulder has been put back in place by the physio but he will undergo scans and is “doubtful” for the rest of the tournament, Italy coach John Davison said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain still completed an unusual World Cup double on Monday — playing in two different sports for two separate countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played at the field hockey World Cup for his native South Africa, but holds an Italian passport now through his ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey, who was dropped on 40 by Anthony Mosca, reached his fifty in 30 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey missed out on a hundred after he holed out to long-on off pace bowler Grant Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hit 13 fours and two sixes in his 54-ball knock to lead Scotland to their first group win, after they lost their first match to the West Indies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ICC, PCB officials meet in Lahore to discuss Pakistan’s boycotted match with India on Feb 15. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/icc-pcb-officials-meet-in-lahore-to-discuss-pakistans-boycotted-match-with-india-on-feb-15</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level visits come a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kamindu heroics steer Sri Lanka past Ireland in T20 World Cup. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971881/kamindu-heroics-steer-sri-lanka-past-ireland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s 11th-hour call to draft in Kamindu Mendis proved a masterstroke as the all-rounder produced a match-turning cameo to set up a 20-run win over Ireland in their T20 World Cup opener at Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamindu’s blistering 44 off 19 balls with four fours and two sixes gave Sri Lanka the late thrust they badly needed to post 163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin trio of Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga and Dunith Wellalage then ran through the Irish middle order, sharing seven wickets to seal a comfortable victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just wanted to score a few boundaries and put a partnership with Kusal Mendis,” said Kamindu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kusal was outstanding today. He deserves a lot of credit. We wanted someone to bat through the innings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They played well during the run chase until the 15th over. We had to keep our calm and we knew they had to take risks and we bowled well towards the end.” Hasaranga claimed three wickets to take his World Cup tally to 40, second only to Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan, who has 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were anxious moments when the leg-spinner, who has a history with hamstring injuries, limped off after his second over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he returned to complete his quota, he moved gingerly, raising questions over his fitness for the rest of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s innings had been stuck in first gear until Kamindu strode in with the scoreboard reading 86 for four in the 14th over, boundaries having dried up against Ireland’s spinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-hander broke a 57-ball boundary drought with a cheeky reverse sweep and then went into overdrive, plundering 21 runs in the 17th over to wrestle back the momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kusal Mendis playing the sheet anchor role in an unbeaten half-century, Sri Lanka found a competitive total from what had looked like a below-par platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland were marshalled by left-arm spinner George Dockrell, who returned a miserly spell of 2-17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 49-run stand between Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector for the third wicket kept Ireland in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a promising 105 for two, Ireland lost their way and folded for 143 in 19.5 overs with Matheesha Pathirana cleaning up with two wickets in the final over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They got 15 runs too many,” said Ireland captain Paul Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bit sloppy in the field and we have plenty of work to do before the next game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were confident with plenty of wickets in hand, but Sri Lanka held their nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Spin is a challenge for us. It wasn’t coming onto the bat as much as we expected. Spin, I believe, is going to play a big role in this tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former champions Sri Lanka are co-hosting the 20-nation showpiece alongside defending champions India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A new report highlights concerns over rising Islamist politics in Bangladesh after the July 2024 uprising. Researchers suggest this shift could negatively affect women and minorities. The analysis indicates a move towards right-wing ideology, with previously suppressed Islamist groups gaining prominence. This transition may introduce formal and informal Islamic governance, posing challenges for women's rights in the country.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam on Sunday landed in Lahore and is set to hold multiple meetings, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was welcomed at the airport by senior officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the PCB press release, Islam will hold a meeting with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as the interior minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB chief’s visit comes a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Controversial remarks in Bangladesh by a politician who questioned women’s ability to perform jobs because of their child-bearing role have caused an uproar ahead of the general election in a country where female workers form the spine of its mainstay garment sector.
Shafiqur Rahman, the chief of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, also ruled out the possibility of a woman assuming the Islamist party’s top post.

      <title>Bangladesh keen on buying rolling stocks. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971817/bangladesh-keen-on-buying-rolling-stocks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Bangladesh has expressed keen interest in procuring freight wagons and passenger coaches after Pakistan offered the rolling stock at prices cheaper than those in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-member delegation, headed by a senior Bangladeshi official, has also visited the Pakistan Railways (PR) carriage factory in Islamabad and the Mughalpura Workshop in Lahore to receive a briefing from the railway authorities and to witness the rolling stock manufacturing process, &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; has learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Lahore-based PR authorities, Mr Farhad Islam, Bangladesh’s Secretary for International Organisations and Consular Affairs and Designate D-8 Commissioner and Mohammad Iqbal Hussain Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan, visited the Mughalpura workshop on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Nasir Khalili, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Carriage and Wagons), briefed the delegation on the overall functioning, technical capabilities, and ongoing projects of the PR’s workshops. A short documentary highlighting the workshops’ operational and working strengths was also shown to the guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shepherd takes hat-trick as West Indies beat Scotland in T20 World Cup. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971704/shepherd-takes-hat-trick-as-west-indies-beat-scotland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pace bowler Romario Shepherd took the first hat-trick of the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup on Saturday to help the West Indies blow away Scotland’s tail and win by 35 runs in their Group C opener in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd grabbed a sensational four wickets in five balls in the 17th over to put an end to Scotland’s hopes of chasing their target of 183.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimron Hetmyer’s 36-ball 64 at Eden Gardens earlier propelled the West Indies to 182-5 in their 20 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots, who only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971513/excited-scots-out-to-prove-they-deserve-last-minute-call-up&quot;&gt;received &lt;/a&gt;a call-up two weeks ago to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, were threatening a famous victory at 114-3 at the end of the 13th over, with big-hitting captain Richie Berrington and Tom Bruce at the crease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 78-run fourth-wicket partnership between Berrington, who made 42, and Tom Bruce (35) had put them back in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But strikes by Jason Holder and then Shepherd’s burst saw Scotland bowled out for 147.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sheppie, he is one of those guys who is willing to learn and improve,” West Indies captain Shai Hope told reporters. “He is always willing to put his hand up, whatever the team requires of him, whether with bat or ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is kind of versatile for us in the middle overs, and it’s good to see him starting the tournament with a bang, and hopefully he will continue doing the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd removed Matthew Cross, for 11, Michael Leask and Oliver Davidson and celebrated wildly before ending with an impressive 5-20 from his three overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holder finished with figures of 3-30 in 3.5 overs as he wrapped up the Scotland innings in 18.5 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s obviously been great to get a feel for the conditions here,” said Berrington, whose side have a quick turnaround as they face Italy at the same ground on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So I’d say there’s definitely a lot of positives we can take from today. And we need to take that into our next game in a couple of days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; id=&quot;six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Six-hitting Hetmyer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots won the toss and elected to field and initially had the West Indies on the back foot with some disciplined bowling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opener Brandon King made 35 as he cut loose in the seventh over to hit pace bowler Safyaan Sharif for a six and two fours off successive balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rotated their bowlers and Leask struck the first blow with his off-spin as he bowled Hope for 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King was out next, falling to debutant left-arm spinner Davidson, caught at backward point for his maiden T20 wicket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Hetmyer took on the opposition attack, hitting six sixes in all, and put on a stand of 81 off 37 balls with Rovman Powell, who made 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer, who was named player of the match, reached his fifty off 22 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell was dismissed, but he kept up the attack with fellow left-hander Sherfane Rutherford, who scored a 13-ball 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer fell to Sharif with Brandon McMullen taking a stunning catch at long-on and Rutherford followed him on the first ball of the next over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-arm pace bowler Brad Currie returned figures of 2-23.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ICC in talks to revive India-Pakistan T20 World Cup clash. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971692/icc-in-talks-to-revive-india-pakistan-t20-world-cup-clash</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) is in talks with the Pakistan Cricket Board to resolve the boycott of its T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; learnt on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsor and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fixture was thrown into doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) reached out to the ICC after a formal communication from the cricket world body, a source close to the developments told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC was seeking a resolution through dialogue and not confrontation, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968499&quot;&gt;refused &lt;/a&gt;to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced &lt;/a&gt;by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a protest, Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;edged out Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said this week that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Excited’ Scots out to prove they deserve last-minute call-up. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971513/excited-scots-out-to-prove-they-deserve-last-minute-call-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KOLKATA: Scotland spinner Mark Watt said on Friday they were confident of proving they belong at the T20 World Cup, despite only being an eleventh-hour replacement for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots failed originally to qualify for the tournament in India and Sri Lanka, but their late call-up will see them face two-time winners the West Indies in Kolkata on Saturday after having only a few days to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh refused to play in India, citing security concerns, and were replaced by the International Cricket Council with Scotland being named as replacement less than two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a frantic dash to India they will also face England, Italy and Nepal in Group ‘C’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Richie Berrington-captained team are determined to make the most of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, firstly, we’re very sympathetic towards Bangladeshi players, but we still massively believe that we should be here,” veteran left-armer Watt told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe that we can beat tea­ms higher ranked than us. So there’s no second guess in our invite into this tournament. We’re all ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scotland will make their fifth consecutive appearance at the T20 World Cup with their best showing in 2021 when they reached the Super 12 stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots stunned the West Indies in the 2022 edition and Watt said they can do it again at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re definitely going out there to win,” the 29-year-old said. “We’ve beaten them twice very recently, so I don’t see why we can’t do it again. We’re very confident.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watt said they had received huge support after being parachuted into the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To be honest, if I had to wrap it all up in one word, it’d just be excitement,” he said of the mood in the team camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, how more excited could they be?  They were sitting in their house doing nothing 10 days ago and now they’re in India at a World Cup.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watt added that being fresh and rested could work in Scotland’s favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know, we’ve had a great week here in India and sometimes actually having a break from the game is a good thing,” said Watt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you can overthink too much about, oh, we’re playing against England, we’re playing against West Indies.” Berrington said it had been a whirlwind couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Obviously it has been unique circumstances,” Berrington told reporters at the captains’ press conference in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 6 - Bangladesh’s leading prime ministerial contender, Tarique Rahman, on Friday rejected a proposal from his main rival for a unity government after elections next week, saying his party was confident of winning on its own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Pakistan’s squad at this year’s T20 world Cup feels like a team again. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971449/why-pakistans-squad-at-this-years-t20-world-cup-feels-like-a-team-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Coke Studio released ‘&lt;em&gt;Phir Se Game Uthadein&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; an anthem for the ODI World Cup set to happen the same year. It was inspired by Slogett and Carlone’s 1992 anthem ‘Who Rules the World’&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the soundtrack to Pakistan’s first and most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1720494&quot;&gt;fabled major victory in cricket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced by Strings and sung by Atif Aslam, the song proclaimed “&lt;em&gt;Jeet ki daastaan, phir ho gi jawaan”&lt;/em&gt; to the same tune as “&lt;em&gt;Who’s gonna be number one, who’s gonna take up the cup?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a dexterity required to mythologise something that has actually happened — Pakistan has done that with the 1992 World Cup. There must have been a time when the historical immediacy of the victory would lend itself as proof that it was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ever since I can remember, the 1992 World Cup has been a pedestalised peak that seems harder and harder to re-mount as the years go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1992 is invoked in every metaphor for victory in Pakistan, sporting or otherwise. It is the incantation we chant when we are inviting good fortune, and the prayer we use to give shape to this imagined fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look for it every time we’re stuck in a quagmire mid-tournament (which is by and large a yearly occurrence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015 invocation was no different. The words &lt;em&gt;josh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;junoon&lt;/em&gt; were used, as they always are, those abstract ideals of hope and zeal and valour that never fully lend themselves in translations to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what was perhaps most intriguing about this remake was the fact that a sad follow-up was shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pakistan was knocked out by Australia (because, of course), the TV and video advertisements that brandished all colours of waving flags a day before were replaced by clips of an imagined aftermath: hung faces in front of projector screens, the green stars and crescents painted on them going flaccid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empty rooftops with stray, limp pieces of confetti sadly billowing in the breeze. A sadder version of the song, essentially saying “we lost, but it’s okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the reprise that particularly tickled my fancy, but the idea that a company producing a hype song for one of the decade’s most anticipated cricketing events had the foresight to produce a version for the sadder, but probably likelier outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like it came as a shock — the campaign included the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1163765&quot;&gt;routine defeat&lt;/a&gt; to India, the fabled 1-4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1171788/world-cup-campaign-pakistan-merely-lived-up-to-its-billing#:~:text=A%20150%2Drun%20loss%20to%20an%20equally%20unpredictable%20West%20Indies%20side&quot;&gt;collapse &lt;/a&gt;against the West Indies that the country woke up before dawn to witness, and of course, an immediately historicised dropped catch in the quarter final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that Pakistan losing or ungracefully bowing out of a tournament isn’t necessarily an unfamiliar feeling. It is often anticipated, often met with a begrudging acknowledgement: “&lt;em&gt;haan yaar, pata tha yehi hoga.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I was thirteen years old during that particular World Cup, and while I do remember all the horrors in technicolour, I cannot help but remember the few gleaming specks of joy that somehow muscled their way out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a then 27-year-old Sarfaraz Ahmed playing perhaps the first iconic knock of his career against South Africa, falling short of a half-century by one run, and Pakistan winning a game that it probably shouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan player Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates in a match during the 2015 ICC World Cup. &amp;mdash; Reuters/File&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/062018444e10ab9.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan player Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates in a match during the 2015 ICC World Cup. — Reuters/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the world, as Wahab Riaz was bowling ball after ball of the spell of his life to Shane Watson, I remember loitering around my school’s staffroom during the quarter final, asking the one teacher who would indulge my classmates and me by giving us an update on the score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each of these trips, we would trundle back to class and take a moment to collectively (mournfully) pray at our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember realising properly for the first time in my life that all the stretched out, worn out, drawn out cliches about coming back to this team over and over again would be true for my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket feels different now than it did back then — it’s faster and more saturated, with so many more places and people and things involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some form of a “World Cup” every year, and it feels difficult to truly feel what a looming World Cup feels like when one is around the corner every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more recently, the constant uncertainty around cricket has been cause for further disillusionment — a Champions Trophy which was supposed to happen entirely at home &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;not having been so&lt;/a&gt;, disappointing showings in 2023 and 2024, and an Asia Cup truncated with political puppet shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into the T20 World Cup, Pakistan is once again at the centre of what looks like a less-than-ideal unfolding: Pakistan has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycotted &lt;/a&gt;the match against India in solidarity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;against ICC’s inconsistent treatment across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/06202528298086f.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the hybrid-model compromise with India in 2024, which promised neutral venues for both teams in the case of an ICC tournament in either one, Pakistan will be playing its group matches in Colombo, with Sri Lanka being cohosts for the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have a long history with our good friend Colombo in the rain, and with a fluctuating percentage of rain in the forecast, the possibility of any of Pakistan’s games being washed out is not zero. There is no margin for error. The realistic thing would be to not hope too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, one can’t help but feel like that after a while; the Pakistan side showing up to this World Cup feels like a team again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Ali Agha’s success at number 3 has unlocked a vein of potential for Pakistan — while his T20 strike rate is around 122, at this position, he has averaged 37 and struck at a solid 168, especially in the recent series against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966516&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970108&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batting aside, Agha has amassed T20 series wins against South Africa, Australia, West Indies and Bangladesh, in addition to two tri-series wins and leading Pakistan to be the finalists in the Asia Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we speak, Saim Ayub is the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971031&quot;&gt;number one&lt;/a&gt; all-rounder in T20 cricket, and Usman Tariq, with his perfectly legal action, has provided Pakistan’s bowling line-up with a contested but undeniable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971011/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-world-cup-exit&quot;&gt;spin arsenal&lt;/a&gt; of Saim, Abrar Ahmed, Usman Tariq, Shadab Khan and Muhammad Nawaz has shaped up to be one of the most promising in the tournament, if the statement 3-0 win against Australia was any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s Abrar Ahmed bowls during the second T20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Australia at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on January 31. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/06201901ab69749.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All histories up till now have shown that Pakistan’s form before a tournament is just about as untrustworthy as Pakistan’s performances during one — but against all my wisdom, I am compelled to hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, cricket is currently at the mercy of administrative mishaps and Pakistan fans are at the mercy of the Pakistan cricket team. But sometimes it is good to remember that not even the most illustrious of wisdoms and an undeniable breadth of knowledge does not absolve us of this reality: when Pakistan plays cricket, we will be tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this time, the sadder songs will remain in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Captain Salman Agha defends ‘X factor’ Usman Tariq’s bowling action ahead of T20 World Cup opener. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971423/captain-salman-agha-defends-x-factor-usman-tariqs-bowling-action-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-opener</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Agha defended off-spinner Usman Tariq’s unorthodox bowling action on Friday and called him the side’s “X factor” on the eve of their Twenty20 World Cup opener against the Netherlands in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariq, who has played three T20 Internationals since his debut against South Africa in November, has been reported twice for a suspect bowling action in the Pakistan Super League. His bowling style culminates in him pausing near the crease before firing the ball in with a side-arm sling-shot action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old claimed two wickets in his second T20 International, against Australia, and Australia batsman Cameron Green — one of his two victims in that match in Lahore — made a chucking gesture after being dismissed as he made his way off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand why we are talking about his action because in my opinion it is a fair action,” Salman told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been tested twice and he has been cleared,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there is no problem in his action. Yes, he is the X factor of the team, and where we feel that we need an X factor, we will definitely use him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having decided to boycott their Group A contest against defending champions India after Bangladesh were excluded from the tournament, Pakistan will have little margin for error in their bid to qualify for the Super 8 stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from India, the group also contains the United States, who stunned Pakistan via the Super Over in the 2024 edition of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman said they would have to be at their best even against second-tier teams like Namibia or the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is very important because you haven’t played much against these sides and you don’t really know their strength and weaknesses,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So it is very, very important to bring your A game, and we as a team only think about how we can execute our plans for 40 overs.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crisis of neutrality at ICC. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971358/crisis-of-neutrality-at-icc</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;UNLESS you’ve been perpetually asleep since 1947, Pakistan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to play an upcoming T20 World Cup group match against India would come as no surprise. Cricket between India and Pakistan has often been seen as a proxy war, and it used to be that this ‘war’ was played out on the field, with the competition between bat and ball determining victory and defeat. That was then. In recent times, even the selection of venues and itineraries has been weaponised. This is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could make a convincing case that India started it, and Pakistan has finally had no option but to respond with tit for tat. India’s cricketers haven’t played in Pakistan since 2008, when the Asia Cup was held in Karachi. Over this period, Pakistan has nevertheless played at Indian venues no less than 19 times, the last in November 2023 as part of the ODI World Cup. Initially, India’s refusal could be justified as a matter of safety and security. After all, even Pakistan’s own team was forced to play in the UAE for several years after the Lahore terrorism of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet once Pakistan’s security situation improved and other top-tier teams such as Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand returned to play at Pakistani venues, India’s cricket board had to fetch another excuse. It came up with the notion of “government permission”, effectively ceding decision-making to the hardline BJP, India’s current ruling party. The mask was finally off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this Indian intransigence, Pakistan’s hosting of last year’s Champions Trophy was reduced to a farce. While the rest of the eight-team tournament proceeded happily in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi, India was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430&quot;&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; to play all five of its matches in Dubai, including a high-voltage group match versus Pakistan on Feb 23 as well as the tournament final on March 9. What explains this extreme asymmetry is India’s clout as a cricketing superpower. With its massive billion-plus audience, India has dominated world cricket through revenues, sponsorships, lobbying and, ultimately, commandeering of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the global body of cricket governance. The situation had become very frustrating for Pakistan to the point that it seemed we had no agency in the matter, no cards left to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent dramatic political developments, however, have reset this calculus. One was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrow&lt;/a&gt; of Indian-backed Sheikh Hasina Wajid in Bangladesh, which has ignited a storm of Bangladeshi fury towards its meddling western neighbour. The other was the backfiring adventurism of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988&quot;&gt;Operation Sindoor&lt;/a&gt;, which has infused Pakistani administrators with a newfound confidence in their posture towards India. The ripples of these two convulsions have now converged in the cricketing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First came Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967562&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to the ICC to have their upcoming World Cup matches shifted outside India to Sri Lanka, a concession that Pakistan had already extracted. Ostensibly triggered by the unexplained expulsion of a Bangladeshi player from an Indian Premier League franchise, Bangladesh’s reluctance to play in India actually reflects worsening political ties. Emboldened by Bangladesh, Pakistan too dug in its heels, announcing ongoing internal deliberations, with a final call on World Cup participation to be made by the Pakistani government on Feb 1. That decision was made public in a tweet: Pakistan would play the World Cup but boycott the group match versus India. The possibility of facing India at a later stage of the tournament was left unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal by the Pakistan Cricket Board, because you are throwing away two valuable points and jeopardising qualification to the next stage. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly. Pakistan has a terrible record against India in ICC tournaments, and it is highly likely we would have lost this match anyway. Fortunately, our other three opponents in the group stage are all associate-level teams which, although potentially a banana peel, is no mountain to climb either. Meanwhile, we have deprived the Indian public of its favourite spectacle — thrashing Pakistan at cricket. Simply put, these matches have become television gold for India. The India-Pakistan match in the 2023 ODI World Cup attracted a collective (terrestrial and digital) viewership of over 400 million, and the viewership of last year’s Champions Trophy India-Pakistan match exceeded 800m. The now-defunct encounter of Feb 15 would surely have garnered similar numbers. Should India and Pakistan clash later at the knockout stage, you can be assured all viewership records will be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selective boycott has triggered polite chatter in Pakistani circles while unleashing uproar in India. That tells you how effective it’s been. Indian hardliners are livid and the Indian public is crushed with disappointment. At the same time, some sensible Indian voices have also emerged. Shashi Tharoor, the erudite Indian politician and scholar, has urged India to reach out to Pakistan and Bangladesh under ICC’s umbrella and “call off this nonsense”. Sharda Ugra, a respected Indian cricket journalist, has laid the blame squarely on India’s cricket board, accusing it of petty egoism and institutional failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt; in this clutter, apart from cricket itself, is Bangladesh, who have every reason to feel hard done by. The could easily have played their matches in Sri Lanka, following Pakistan’s precedent; yet the ICC threatened them with replacement, and that threat was eventually carried out. This leaves the ICC with a lot to answer for. As an organisation tasked with the welfare of global cricket, it should be a neutral body; instead, it has been reduced to a mouthpiece for India. All cricketing nations need to join forces, take principled stands, and hold the ICC accountable. The costs of doing nothing are simply too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The writer, a professor of neurology at Aga Khan University, has written on cricket for international publications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India’s stranglehold on cricket questioned after Pakistan’s show of solidarity with BD. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971308/indias-stranglehold-on-cricket-questioned-after-pakistans-show-of-solidarity-with-bd</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;INDIA’S dominance over world cricket has been evident for nearly two decades, underpinned by its vast population and the commercial power of its domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Indian Premier League in 2008 only entrenched that advantage, enabling the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to amass unprecedented financial influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That influence has seldom been questioned, even when it appeared to undermine competitive balance. The elephant in the room — that international cricket increasingly operates on terms set by India — is no longer being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; its T20 World Cup group match against India has drawn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970619/principles-before-commercial-interests-cricketers-politicians-react-to-pakistan-boycotting-india-match-in-t20-world-cup&quot;&gt;rare public backing&lt;/a&gt; from senior voices in cricket commentary, who have questioned the International Cricket Council’s consistency and the growing influence of commercial and political considerations on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUSSAIN, ATHERTON FLAG INCONSISTENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking on the Sky Cricket Podcast alongside Michael Atherton, said Pakistan and Bangladesh were justified in pushing back against what he described as selective enforcement of ICC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At some stage someone has got to say enough is enough — can we just get back to playing cricket?” Hussain said, arguing that the central issue was consistency rather than politics. He questioned whether the ICC would have adopted a similarly rigid stance had India been unable to travel due to government directives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hussain praised Bangladesh for defending its position after being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;dropped from the tournament&lt;/a&gt; when the ICC declined to relocate its matches from India to Sri Lanka, and described Pakistan’s boycott of the India fixture as a necessary stand against a system increasingly shaped by financial and political power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atherton echoed those concerns, pointing to previous instances in which India was allowed to play at neutral venues after refusing to tour Pakistan. Denying Bangladesh similar flexibility, he warned, risked undermining the credibility of international cricket’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If allowances have been made before, you can’t suddenly decide not to make them now,” Atherton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former England batter Mark Butcher went further, calling Pakistan’s selective boycott a “masterstroke” that exposed the tournament’s financial fragility. By targeting only the India match — the most commercially valuable fixture in world cricket — Butcher said Pakistan had highlighted the extent to which broadcasters, the ICC and co-host India depended on a single contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole thing rests on that game,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHEHBAZ DEFENDS DECISION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was against this backdrop that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971047&quot;&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the decision, saying Pakistan would not play the match against India while continuing to participate in the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a federal cabinet meeting on Wednesday, he said Pakistan stood with Bangladesh and that while sport should remain free of politics, principles of fairness could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh, the move was welcomed. Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan thanked Pakistan for its support, calling it a principled stand against preferential treatment and double standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi also weighed in, urging the ICC to ensure equal treatment of all member boards and arguing that cricket should serve as a bridge when politics divides nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all former players, however, supported the boycott. Former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee said he hoped the match would still go ahead, calling for politics to be kept out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s get the politics out of it,” Lee said on the Mr Cricket UAE podcast. “I really hope the match happens. The whole world watches when India and Pakistan play one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision, however, does not come without risk. The ICC has warned of potential long-term consequences for Pakistan cricket, including sanctions, withheld revenue distributions and compensation claims from broadcasters. Some observers question whether the gesture, however principled, adequately accounts for the financial asymmetries that already favour India.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pemra remains ‘headless’ as new chief awaits  PM Office nod. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971340/pemra-remains-headless-as-new-chief-awaits-pm-office-nod</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Even though the country’s electronic media regulator has been without a chairperson since October, a summary for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964833&quot;&gt;appointment&lt;/a&gt; of Ambreen Jan as head of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) has been pending with the Prime Minister’s Office for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Jan, a former federal secretary for information, was selected by the parliamentary panel as Pemra chairperson. If her appointment is approved, she will be the first woman to head the authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a reliable source, Ambreen Jan’s confirmation has been held up due to “objections regarding security clearance”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Jan is a former Grade-22 officer and has served as information secretary, the director general of Radio Pakistan and as managing director of PTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also served as press counsellor in Bangladesh from 2011 to 2018, when Islamabad-Dhaka ties were under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was among the five shortlisted candidates considered for the Pemra job, along with retired Brigadier Anwar Ahmed, journalist Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf and Dr Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final shortlist narrowed the choice to three candidates, omitting the names of Irfan Ashraf and Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under an amendment made to&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pemra.gov.pk/assets/uploads/legal/Ordinance_2002.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Pemra Act,&lt;/a&gt; a parliamentary committee consisting of four members — two each from the National Assembly and the Senate — will recommend a candidate for appointment as head of the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury benches and the opposition will have one member each from the National Assembly and the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parliamentary committee finalised and recommended the candidate for appointment by the President over a month ago, but the file is awaiting onward transmission to the Presidency from the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saleem Baig, the previous Pemra chairman, was also an officer of the Information Group. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1410839&quot;&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and reappointed in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Baig retired in September last year after becoming the longest serving head of the Authority. His predecessor, Absar Alam, was removed from the post by the Lahore High Court in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulator’s mandate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pemra was established under the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw2-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2FrbZ8=-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj-con-9741&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pemra Ordinance 2002&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate and regulate the private electronic media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has mandate to improve the standards of information, education and entertainment and to facilitate dissemination of information related to current affairs, religious matters, art, culture as well as science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key segments regulated by Pemra include Direct to Home (DTH) broadcasting, satellite television, landing rights permission (LRP), FM Radio and Cable TV.&lt;/p&gt;

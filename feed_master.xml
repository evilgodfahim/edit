      <description>Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, living in exile, has branded the recent February 12 polls a 'pre-planned election of deception and farce.' She alleges widespread manipulation and unrealistic turnout figures. Meanwhile, her rival Khaleda Zia's party, the BNP, secured a significant victory, prompting calls for Hasina's extradition from India to face trial.</description>

      <description>Bangladesh Election: Sheikh Hasina has sharply rejected the results of Bangladesh's 13th National Parliamentary Election. She described the February 12 vote as a disgrace and a farce. Hasina alleged administrative manipulation and numerical fraud. She demanded the annulment of the election and the resignation of the interim administration. Hasina called for fresh elections under a neutral caretaker government to restore voting rights.</description>

      <title>T20 World Cup: India and Pakistan fans flock to Colombo, windfall for tourism. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972941/t20-world-cup-india-and-pakistan-fans-flock-to-colombo-windfall-for-tourism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prices of flights and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared as thousands of fans flock to the city to watch India play Pakistan on Sunday in cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighbouring countries and cricket rivals are due to meet during the group stage of the tournament, which is being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, after Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;reversed &lt;/a&gt;a decision to boycott the match earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game at Sri Lanka’s largest stadium is sold out with roughly 35,000 tickets sold, and ahead of the match, most hotels in Colombo have doubled their prices — the cost of a room has climbed as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the match was finalised this week, last-minute bookings led to fuller flights from major cities like Chennai and Delhi, according to three Colombo travel agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to around $623-$756, while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 per cent to roughly $666.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nalin Jayasundera, President of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), said hotels were booked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices,” Jayasundera said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, famous for its ancient temples, pristine beaches, and lush tea plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that hosting more sporting events could boost Sri Lanka’s economic growth, which is recovering from a severe financial crisis and a recent cyclone, which killed 650 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20pc of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island nation is hoping to position itself as a neutral venue for matches between political rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is clearly showing confidence in Sri Lanka as a neutral cricket venue. Whether it’s India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, this is a welcome message to all South Asian countries that they can play cricket in Sri Lanka,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s going to be a great experience, said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend who is flying in from New Zealand. I’m really excited about this match.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sultan added he thought Pakistan absolutely could come out on top on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He publicly supported Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami in the recent election. This move has reignited debates about his credibility. Critics question his understanding of complex political movements. His past controversies regarding fundraising and factual accuracy have resurfaced. The endorsement of Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party, has drawn significant backlash.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Destined to a perilous life with no right to an education or to vote, state recognition ‘gives them hope’, campaigners say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the decades that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/17/children-trapped-bangladesh-brothel-village-video?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot;&gt;the Daulatdia brothel&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh has existed, children born there have been invisible, unable to be registered because their mothers were sex workers and their fathers unknown. Now, for the first time, all 400 of them in the brothel village have their own birth certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That milestone was reached after a push by campaigners who have spent decades working with Bangladesh’s undocumented children born in brothels or on the street. It means they can finally access the rights afforded to other citizens: the ability to go to school, to be issued a passport or to vote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/feb/13/invisible-children-born-in-the-brothels-of-bangladesh-finally-get-birth-certificates&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>PM Shehbaz to attend inaugural Board of Peace meeting in US, confirms FO. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972727/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-inaugural-board-of-peace-meeting-in-us-confirms-fo</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi confirmed on Thursday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting in the US, saying that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would also accompany him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrabi’s confirmation follows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972442&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that said PM Shehbaz was expected to visit Washington on February 18 and represent Pakistan at the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, which is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” Andrabi said during a weekly briefing of the FO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that information about other members of Pakistan’s delegation and its engagements would be shared in due course of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked specifically whether Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir would be included in the delegation, the FO spokesperson reiterated: “We will share these details in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not have the details — neither on the itinerary, nor on the composition of the delegation. I can confirm that the prime minister will lead the delegation and that the deputy prime minister and foreign minister will be part of the delegation. This is the extent of information right now. We will, of course, update you in due course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is among the 14 countries that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968339&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; the charter of the Board of Peace on January 22 on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, becoming a founding member of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository. President Trump has designated the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the board’s headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November 2025 authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971789&quot;&gt;violations&lt;/a&gt; by Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Trump’s Gaza plan unveiled late last year, the Board of Peace was originally intended to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance following a ceasefire, before being expanded to address global conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rights experts and scholars have, however,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965054&quot;&gt; criticised the concept&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that a US-led board overseeing the affairs of a foreign territory resembles a colonial structure. The absence of Palestinian representation on the board has further deepened these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journalist also pointed out during the FO briefing on Thursday that there was no representation from Gaza on the board. Highlighting US support for Israel as well, the journalist asked: “How reliable would this Board of Peace prove to be for the people of Gaza?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his response, Andrabi said, “We have joined the Board of Peace in good faith, as I highlighted in my previous briefing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also pointed that Pakistan had not joined the board in isolation and not as “one voice, but as collective voice of eight Islamic-Arab countries”, which had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944220&quot;&gt;worked with Trump&lt;/a&gt; on his Gaza plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our collective voice is resonating in the Board of Peace, and we will continue to strive for the rights, peace and prosperity of the people of Palestine, aimed at the long-term solution of the Palestine issue — to create a state of Palestine, in accordance with the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, our engagement is both for short-term, medium-term and long-term solution of the plight of the Palestinian people,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972698/israel-has-joined-trumps-board-of-peace-netanyahu-says&quot;&gt;Israel joining the board&lt;/a&gt;, the FO spokesperson said: “It is their decision. We are not obliged to offer any comment. We will engage with the Board of Peace with positivity of intent, and as I said, our prime minister will attend the Board of Peace meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#shot-down-a-number-of-indian-rafale-jets&quot; id=&quot;shot-down-a-number-of-indian-rafale-jets&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Shot down a number of Indian Rafale jets’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrabi was also for clarification following Trump’s recent remarks that 10 aircraft were shot down during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509&quot;&gt;four-day conflict&lt;/a&gt; between India and Pakistan in May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 months, the US president has stated numerous times that aircraft were shot down during the conflict — albeit without specifying whose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially stating that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;five jets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were shot down, Trump gradually raised that number to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951783&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;seven in October&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953444&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;eight in November&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the question on Trump’s statement, the FO spokesperson said: “We have stated it previously, and I wish to reiterate it here that Pakistan is appreciative of the role of the United States during our 90-hour war with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The role of the United States was for peace, for prevention of war and prevention of violence. So, in that context, President Trump’s statements, previous statements, and these statements are all obviously welcomed and endorsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As regards the fighter planes: this is a matter of history,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Pakistan shot down “a number of Indian Rafale jets, and the evidence is all over — available internationally, corroborated by international reports, including by the manufacturers of these planes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This demonstrated that Pakistan was able to deter Indian aggression through conventional means. This is also an indicator for the future — any future Indian aggression would be dealt forthrightly and forcefully with all our resources,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#weaponisation-of-cricket-is-regrettable&quot; id=&quot;weaponisation-of-cricket-is-regrettable&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Weaponisation of cricket is regrettable’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the session, the FO spokesperson was asked whether Pakistan’s decision to play the T20 World Cup match against India after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;announcing &lt;/a&gt;an initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott &lt;/a&gt;was the consequence of back-channel cricket diplomacy between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Andrabi said: “Cricket is a game that we all love and we all cherish. We grew up playing this game. Weaponisation of cricket, politicisation of cricket is regrettable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that the government’s decision to not play against India “reflected the resolve of the government of Pakistan to not let cricket be weaponised and politicised”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our subsequent decision to play reflected our magnanimity, after the relevant cricket authorities realised that they had weaponised and politicised cricket, particularly weaponised against Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you are aware, the Bangladesh side and Sri Lankan side (host of this game) were in touch with our government and cricket board,” he highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the decision to play the game, is reflective of the magnanimity shown by our prime minister as a result of contacts made by the brotherly countries of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as well as by a realisation within the relevant authorities managing cricket internationally and in India, that weaponisation and politicisation of cricket is wrong, is unwarranted, and it defies the spirit of the beloved game of cricket that we all cherish,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why playing India is the smartest decision PCB has made in months. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972538/why-playing-india-is-the-smartest-decision-pcb-has-made-in-months</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In international cricket, principle is often loud, emotional and instantly gratifying. Strategy, on the other hand, is quieter, slower, and frequently misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;eventually agree to play India &lt;/a&gt;on February 15 falls squarely in the latter category, and despite the initial optics, it is the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic boycott call did what it needed to do early on. It created noise, unsettled the International Cricket Council (ICC), and earned Pakistan something it has been desperately short of in recent years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970749&quot;&gt;an ally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s open friction with the ICC and India over security, scheduling and governance issues suddenly aligned its interests with Pakistan’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials taking place in Lahore on Feb 8, 2026. &amp;mdash; Screengrab via PCB video&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/1116263346e940a.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alignment may be situational for now, but in a cricketing ecosystem where Pakistan often finds itself isolated, even a temporary ally matters. In what seemed like an emotional and loud drama initially, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has done something that suggests calculation rather than impulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s stance carried weight morally as it played its strongest card not for immediate self-benefit, but in visible solidarity with another board, one with far less financial leverage and political capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode also forced a conversation about power imbalance in world cricket and structural marginalisation of smaller boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match.

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;standing with Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan positioned itself not as a lone dissenter, but as part of a broader discomfort within the “middle tier” of cricket nations. However, the PCB has bills to pay, and such symbolic gestures, regardless of their strength, are not going to balance the books, which is why deciding to play the India game is a strategic win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking the field on Sunday, Pakistan will avoid the twin disasters a boycott would have triggered: forfeiture of crucial match points and loss of ICC revenue. The former would not have hurt Pakistan competitively as much, given their record against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 times the two arch-rivals have faced each other in the shortest format, Pakistan have only won three, while India dominates with 13 victories. Instead, it was the huge potential loss of money that got the governing body quiver at Pakistan’s boycott call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s players walk back to the pavilion at the end of the Asia Cup 2025 T20 international cricket match against India at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai, the UAE on September 14. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/1116261263d8542.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match. It is a financial event, the economic engine that quietly funds the ICC’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India receives 38.5 per cent of the ICC’s revenue distribution in the current cycle, which is more than what the next six boards receive combined. Pakistan’s share hovers around five to six per cent. This disparity is not an accident; it reflects market gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian broadcast market alone drives the bulk of ICC media rights, a deal worth billions over a four-year cycle, which is the major source of revenue for the governing body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan celebrates after the dismissal of Netherlands&amp;rsquo; Max O&amp;rsquo;Dowd during the 2026 ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match between Pakistan and the Netherlands at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo on February 7. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/11162547c3c830c.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan celebrates after the dismissal of Netherlands’ Max O’Dowd during the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match between Pakistan and the Netherlands at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo on February 7. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite receiving the lion’s share, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)’s income doesn’t depend on the ICC, as its revenue is heavily dominated by the Indian Premier League (IPL) and bilateral series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, any financial loss to the ICC would not have impacted BCCI as strongly as it would have Pakistan and other cricket boards, whose incomes are heavily dependent on their ICC revenue share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason India-Pakistan contests are manufactured into every ICC tournament. They are the biggest television events in cricket, reportedly accounting for 20-30pc of a tournament’s total broadcast value in a single match. The marquee encounter does not fund India’s cricket at a large scale, but it subsidises the ecosystem in which Pakistan cricket survives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To risk that revenue for a dispute that was not even Pakistan’s own would have been strategically naive. Agreeing to play India also repairs and strengthens the PCB’s working relationship with other boards, particularly Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/in-phone-call-with-pm-sri-lanka-president-urges-pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india&quot;&gt;strongly requested&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to call off its boycott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are boards that Pakistan has often relied on for neutral venues, logistical cooperation and political support within ICC committees. A unilateral boycott would have made Pakistan appear rigid, pushing it further to the margins at a time when it needs quiet diplomacy, not loud isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, even the ICC has been accommodating towards the PCB, bending significantly by agreeing to a hybrid hosting model to ensure that Pakistan does not have to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing the governing body further, especially when Pakistan lacks the financial muscle to challenge it head-on, would have been a dangerous escalation. The larger context is bleak, as the ICC is effectively run by India. This is not a conspiracy, but an economic reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s billion-plus market dictates broadcast value, sponsorship interest and administrative power. Complaining about reality without a long-term counter strategy is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While boycotts feel defiant, the harsh reality is that they change nothing. Pakistan currently does not possess the commercial influence or on-field dominance required to force systemic change. That does not mean it should abandon principle altogether, but it must choose its battles wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By taking a firm stance and then agreeing to play, the PCB has extracted narrative value without incurring material loss. It has shown that it can push back, but also that it understands its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sport that is increasingly governed by realpolitik, that balance matters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rawalpindi secures pacer Naseem Shah for Rs86.5m as bidding on fast bowlers concludes at PSL 11 auction in Lahore. [ dawn ]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is underway in Lahore, with fast bowler Naseem Shah sold to Rawalpindi for Rs86.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight franchises have started bidding on spinners, following the conclusion of the previous round, which saw wicket-keepers being auctioned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi spinner Rishaad Hossain was sold to Rawalpindi for a bid of Rs30m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up were Mamoon Imtiaz, Ali Majid, Momin Qamar, Peter Hatzoglou, and Arif Yaqoob, who did not receive any bids. Faisal Akram was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for the final bid of Rs12.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#sahibaza-farhan-sold-off-to-sialkot-stallionz&quot; id=&quot;sahibaza-farhan-sold-off-to-sialkot-stallionz&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sahibaza Farhan sold off to Sialkot Stallionz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bidding on wicket keepers began with Azam Khan — at the base price of Rs11m. With the final bids of Rs31.5m by Sialkot Stallionz and Rs32.5m by Karachi Kings, the latter managed to secure Khan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sialkot Stallionz bagged Sahibzada Farhan against Karachi Kings, with a bid of Rs57m.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up were Sri Lankan cricketer Dinesh Chandimal and West Indies’ Johnson Charles, both of whom went unsold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the bidding for fast bowlers, Muhammad Ali was sold off to Hyderabad Houstan Kingsmen in a last-minute bid of Rs21.5m against Rawalpindi’s Rs20.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Chris Jordan, who went unsold after receiving zero bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lahore Qalandars regained fast-bowler Haris Rauf at Rs76m against the Rawalpindi team’s Rs74.5m bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Hasnain, at the base price of  received no bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karachi Kings put in the first bid for Naseem Shah at Rs65m, followed by Islamabad United bidding Rs66.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a series of back-and-forth bids between the two, Rawalpindi came in at a bid of Rs86.5m, following which Karachi Kings bowed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second round began with Barbadian cricketer Kyle Mayers at the base price of Rs11m, who went unsold after no bids were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand’s Colin Munroe went unsold as well. Karachi Kings bagged Australian batsman David Warner at Rs79m after a round of back-and-forth bidding with Peshawar Zalmi.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African batsman Rilee Rossouw was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for Rs55m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs11m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-rounders Hussain Talat, Asif Afridi, Danish Aziz, and Muhammad Zeeshan at the base price of Rs11m received no bids as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian cricketer Abhishek Sharma hospitalised ahead of T20 World Cup game with Namibia. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972514/indian-cricketer-abhishek-sharma-hospitalised-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-game-with-namibia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prolific Indian opener Abhishek Sharma has been hospitalised with an upset stomach ahead of the group match against Namibia at the T20 World Cup, a cricket board official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive left-hander is key to India’s chances of defending their title at the 20-team tournament and is doubtful for the Group A fixture on Thursday in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old was admitted to a Delhi hospital on Tuesday after he missed training with a stomach issue he carried from the opener in Mumbai, the official told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate acknowledged the concern on Tuesday, saying the batsman had “still got a few issues with his tummy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope that he’ll be available for the game in a few days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhishek was out for a duck in India’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971699/suryakumars-unbeaten-84-rescues-india-against-usa-in-t20-world-cup&quot;&gt;win over the United States&lt;/a&gt; but has been a strong performer in the lead-up to the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; arch-rivals Pakistan in a blockbuster on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Pakistani government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it was withdrawing its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decision to boycott&lt;/a&gt; the match with India, which had been taken previously in the wake of Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to tour India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to move forward with the much-anticipated game came after protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;negotiations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the ICC and the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consultations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders, and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>US trade office removes controversial map of India from social media after Pakistan protests. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972510/us-trade-office-removes-controversial-map-of-india-from-social-media-after-pakistan-protests</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map, which accompanied a USTR press release announcing a framework for an interim US-India trade agreement, showed the entire Jammu and Kashmir region — including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan — within Indian boundaries. It also depicted China’s Aksai Chin region as part of India, despite the fact that the area is claimed by China and remains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1772898&quot;&gt;disputed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971369&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970640&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227&quot;&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh's recent trade agreement with the United States appears to be a double-edged sword for its garment industry. Although it provides zero-duty access, the stipulation to use US-sourced cotton and fibers undermines their competitive edge, given their current dependence on alternative suppliers. Additionally, the obligation to import US agricultural products and energy adds financial strain.</description>

      <title>Bangladeshi woman moves Lahore High Court against ‘unjustified’ offloading by FIA. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972401/bangladeshi-woman-moves-lahore-high-court-against-unjustified-offloading-by-fia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: An elderly woman, who was allegedly born in Bangladesh and was trafficked and sold in Pakistan some 35 years ago, has approached the Lahore High Court against the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for offloading her from a Dhaka-bound flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Razia Bibi, 58, filed a petition through her counsel, Ali Changezi Sandhu, and also sought imposition of a fine on the FIA for offloading her, allegedly without any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the petition, the counsel alleged that the petitioner was kidnapped in Bangladesh and illegally brought to Pakistan, where she was sold in Karachi some 35 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner was forced into marriage with her ‘purchaser’ in Pakistan and later shifted to Kasur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the petitioner, who is now a Pakistani citizen, recently reconnected with her Bangladeshi family through social media and her mother pleaded to meet her one last time in her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer stated when the petitioner, on Feb 27, 2025, reached the Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore, to travel to Bangladesh, the FIA immigration staff offloaded her without providing any justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner filed an application with the interior ministry for action against the “unlawful” act of the FIA officials, but to no avail so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argued that on the basis of mere suspicion and assumptions regarding illegal travel and human smuggling, thousands of Pakistani youths had been falling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961655&quot;&gt;victim&lt;/a&gt; to the FIA’s “unlawful offloading”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, offloading an elderly woman without any reason clearly indicates that the FIA engages in illegal practices, the counsel alleged, and sought an order for the agency to compensate the petitioner for the amount she spent on her air ticket and visa fee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sensible decision. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972476/sensible-decision</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER days-long negotiations, Pakistan moved for the greater good of world cricket when its government gave the national cricket team the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;go-ahead&lt;/a&gt; to play their Twenty20 World Cup match against India on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play the blockbuster fixture, which is the revenue generator for the International Cricket Council, after Scotland had been drafted in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh at the World Cup following the latter country’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for their matches due to security concerns. The Pakistan Cricket Board had protested the decision of the India-led ICC. While the team was allowed to travel to the tournament it was instructed to forfeit the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its finances in danger, the ICC came to the table with its director Imran Khawaja flying to Pakistan over the weekend. Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Aminul Islam also arrived, with Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi at the centre of negotiations. Pakistan had already been requested by Sri Lanka, where the national team is playing their matches of the World Cup, and the UAE to reconsider their decision. The PCB, however, was fighting a bigger battle: to ensure equality in world cricket against the governing body that has for long acted on India’s whims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, it has succeeded. The ICC has not penalised Bangladesh, while also granting it hosting rights for a tournament in the 2028-2031 cycle to mitigate the impact from its ouster from the World Cup. It therefore made sense for Pakistan to change their stance; going ahead with the World Cup match against India means ensuring financial security for the cricket world, especially the associate members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should not be forgotten. It should also mark the start of a new era in cricket governance. The politicisation of the sport has been a menace that has hindered the growth of the game for long. Sports should not be used as a propagation of political messaging and it is high time this practice was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the arrangement between Pakistan and India, which sees both sides play their matches of an event in either country at neutral venues, ends, the ICC should look to ensuring that it normalises bilateral cricketing ties between the two arch-rivals. That would embellish the ICC’s legitimacy as a neutral body that is focused on making sure that the game stays above petty politicking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>India need not be concerned about the new trade agreement between Bangladesh and the United States. Former Indian envoy Veena Sikri states Bangladesh cannot afford the promised Boeing jet purchases. She also notes that Bangladesh's access to US markets is tied to sourcing materials like yarn and cotton from the USA. India already supplies these competitively and quickly.</description>

      <title>Over 150,000 cops to guard ‘risky’ polling stations in Bangladesh. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972439/over-150000-cops-to-guard-risky-polling-stations-in-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s police chief said on Tuesday that more than 150,000 officers will be deployed for this week’s elections, warning that more than half of polling stations were flagged as vulnerable to violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that five people were killed and more than 600 injured in political clashes during the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972185&quot;&gt; campaign&lt;/a&gt; period from Dec 11 to Feb 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 157,000 police officers, backed by 100,000 soldiers and other security forces, will guard Thursday’s vote — the first since a mass uprising toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are 1,000 per cent confident about doing our part,” Inspector General of Police Baharul Alam told reporters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman warns of ‘huge’ challenges ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country of 170 million has remained in political turmoil since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; against Hasina, when police carried out a deadly crackdown during her failed bid to cling to power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alam said police had assessed that “more than 24,000 polling centres have been marked as either high-risk or moderately risky” for possible unrest, violence or ballot stuffing — more than half of the 42,000 centres nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The location of some centres is very remote, and there is intense competition, and hostility among candidates and their supporters,” he said, adding that 1,300 police guns looted during the 2024 unrest have still not been recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In high-risk and moderately risky centres, police will carry out patrol duty with body-worn cameras for the first time,” Alam said. He added that police were determined to ensure the polls were peaceful, but said he accepted that distrust of his force remained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is quite understandable why people do not trust the police,” he said, adding: “Over the last 15 ye­­a­rs, based on what we have delivered — in fact, for the last 150 years, our predecessors mostly beat people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bangla­de­sh’s leading prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman said on Tuesday he faces “huge” challenges if he wins elections this week, vowing to repair a country he said was looted under the previous ousted government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to ensure a normal situation in the country, so that people are safe,” Rahman told &lt;em&gt;AFP.&lt;/em&gt; But he warned the task ahead would be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EU parliament adopts twin texts hardening migration policy. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972438/eu-parliament-adopts-twin-texts-hardening-migration-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRASBOURG: The European Parliament on Tuesday definitively adopted two flagship texts tightening EU migration policy, championed by an alliance of right-wing and far-right lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is seeking to make it easier for its 27 member states to send asylum seekers to countries they did not come from but that Europe deems “safe”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has sought to test the concept with centres in Albania. The migrant centres have, however, largely stood empty since being opened in 2024 because of legal challenges, with many Italian judges viewing the scheme as unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the EU measures adopted on Tuesday is expected to facilitate this approach, to the dismay of human rights advocates and left-wing groups, who warn about the treatment asylum seekers may face in such countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green MEP Melissa Camara called it “another step in the dehumanisation of the European Union’s migration policy,” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;charging that the dignity of asylum seekers was being “trampled” on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission rejects the criticism, insisting that any country receiving migrants under the scheme must respect fundamental rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key measure approved by parliament is the creation of a list of countries the EU considers “safe” — effectively limiting asylum prospects for their nationals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list, which includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia, is intended to speed up the processing of asylum claims and, where appropriate, accelerate returns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Citizens expect us to deliver on our promises regarding migration policy, and that is exactly what we are doing today,” conservative lawmaker Lena Dupont told the assembly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s political centre of gravity has shifted firmly right in recent years, and a decline in irregular entries — down around 25 per cent in 2025 compared to 2024 — has not eased the political pressure to act on the hot-button issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly one million people applied for asylum in the EU last year and about 440,000 were granted protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PAF’s participation in Saudi defence expo reinforces Pakistan’s position as ‘emerging hub of aerospace innovation’. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972255/pafs-participation-in-saudi-defence-expo-reinforces-pakistans-position-as-emerging-hub-of-aerospace-innovation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;JF-17&lt;/a&gt; Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967005&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024. Azerbaijan had become the third country to acquire JF-17 fighters after Myanmar and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COAS Munir lauds ‘character, courage, competence’ shown by soldiers in ongoing fight against terrorism. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972253/coas-munir-lauds-character-courage-competence-shown-by-soldiers-in-ongoing-fight-against-terrorism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded the “character, courage, and competence” demonstrated by soldiers in the ongoing fight against terrorism, the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an ISPR &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7615&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the CDF made these remarks while addressing the closing ceremony of the 9th International Pakistan Army Team Spirit (PATS) Competition as the chief guest on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming the core values of the army, the CDF “underscored the enduring soldierly attributes of ‘character, courage and competence’, which have been consistently demonstrated by Pakistani soldiers, particularly in the ongoing fight against terrorism”, the military’s media wing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field Marshal Munir also “commended all participating teams for their exceptional professionalism, physical and mental endurance, operational competence and high morale displayed during the exercise”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He emphasised the importance of such multinational engagements in enhancing collective preparedness and adapting to the evolving character of modern warfare,” the press release added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISPR described PATS Competition as a 60-hour-long patrolling exercise, designed to “enhance professional military skills through the exchange of innovative ideas, tactical experiences and best practices among participating teams”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise, held from February 5 to 9, was carried out in the semi-mountainous terrain of Punjab, “providing a realistic and challenging operational environment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the years, PATS has evolved into a prestigious and highly competitive military exercise, recognised for promoting professional excellence and mutual learning among participating nations,” the statement noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affirmed that the forum “continues to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and understanding, while fostering camaraderie and team spirit in a demanding operational setting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s PATS Competition featured 19 countries — including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, the United States of America, and Uzbekistan — while Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand attended the exercise as observers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 16 domestic teams from the army and the navy, along with observers from the air force, also participated in the event, ISPR stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDF also presented awards to the outstanding participants of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“International observers and defence attachés from participating countries also attended the event and expressed appreciation for high standard of professionalism, organisation, and conduct demonstrated throughout the exercise,” the press release read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the CDF also witnessed miscellaneous training activities at the National Counter Terrorism Centre in Pabbi, including a visit to the newly established Tactical Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lauded the efforts of troops and the technical team and emphasised the importance of simulator-based training to complement traditional training methods, ISPR said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh poll race heats up on final day of campaigning. [ dawn ]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Tens of thousands of supporters attend rival rallies across Dhaka&lt;br /&gt;• Voters will elect lawmakers to a 350-seat parliament&lt;br /&gt;• BNP, led by Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique, widely seen as a frontrunner&lt;br /&gt;• BNP’s main rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Shafiqur Rahman, allied with the student-led National Citizen Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat parliament, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — led by Tarique Rahman, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; in December after 17 years in exile — widely tipped as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s key rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party that is led by Shafiqur Rahman and has allied with the National Citizen Party (NCP) that was formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Justice’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Long live the revolution’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 10 - China’s influence in Bangladesh, boosted by the 2024 ouster of New Delhi‑aligned leader Sheikh Hasina, is likely to deepen after this week's election, although politicians and analysts say India is too large a neighbour to be sidelined completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PSL franchise Multan Sultans sold for record Rs2.45bn; new owner says name will be changed to Rawalpindi. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972074/psl-franchise-multan-sultans-sold-for-record-rs245bn-new-owner-says-name-will-be-changed-to-rawalpindi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Super League franchise (PSL) Multan Sultans on Monday was sold to Walee Technologies for a record Rs2.45 billion ahead of the tournament’s 11th edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the auction in Lahore, show host Fakhr-i-Alam informed bidders that the winning bid would also cover the annual fee to maintain ownership of the team for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MultanSultans/status/2020864897551106059&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the auction ceremony, the new owner of the team announced that they would be changing the name to Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you ready for a surprise? We will be going for Rawalpindi!” announced the company’s chief executive officer, Ahsan Tahir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the ceremony, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated Walee Technologies on their successful bid and expressed gratitude to former board chairman Najam Sethi for his vision for the Multan Sultans franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This Multan Sultans was created by Najam Sethi &lt;em&gt;sahib&lt;/em&gt; and the person who started this journey; we are so pleased he is with us today,” Naqvi said, inviting Sethi onto the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Sethi said, “I’m obviously delighted to be here; this is the culmination of a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m obviously over the moon that it’s come through under Mohsin Naqvi, who is a dear, dear friend of mine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sethi hailed the winning bid as a “great moment for Pakistan cricket”, adding that Naqvi would give good news “beyond PSL” over the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, at a press conference with representatives from Walee Technologies, Naqvi said that the future of the Multan Sultans brand would have to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot ask the person paying Rs2.45bn to keep the name Multan Sultans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we discussed auctioning Multan Sultans, we planned to keep it for one or two years. But there was a good environment in the market and we were already auctioning five or six teams,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB chief noted that there were concerns, given the brand’s age and the possibility of damage to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, Multan Sultans is very close to my heart, so we will come up with a solution,” Naqvi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about the criteria for setting the opening bid at Rs1.82bn, he replied that it was the second-highest bid for the Sialkot team, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965821&quot;&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; for Rs1.85bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a question about ongoing meetings with a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pakistan’s boycott of the match with India in the T20 World Cup, Naqvi replied, “The issue was Bangladesh’s. We did not want to let their point of view go; they are our brothers and you saw the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things are happening, which is why I won’t say much, but the ICC and the Bangladesh board are in that phase where if I say anything, it won’t be right. We’ll update you once we receive information,” the PCB chief said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said that “guests need to be respected” when asked about the attitude of the visiting ICC delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walee Technologies is a global company specialising in projects in the media, finance and technology sectors, according to their &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://walee.pk/about-walee/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which added that the company had also earlier acquired PSL livestreaming rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise, started in 2017 under the name Multan Sultans, competed in eight consecutive editions of the PSL, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1631329&quot;&gt;winning &lt;/a&gt;the league in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, the franchise was left &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957302&quot;&gt;ownerless &lt;/a&gt;after the PCB did not extend a renewal offer to owner Ali Khan Tareen. The PCB then announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963738&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;take over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the franchise for the upcoming tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bids were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966930&quot;&gt;invited &lt;/a&gt;on January 14 and their technical evaluation was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970696&quot;&gt;completed &lt;/a&gt;by February 3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scotland spoil Italy’s T20 World Cup debut with big win. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972064/scotland-spoil-italys-t20-world-cup-debut-with-big-win</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;T20 World Cup debutants Italy had a bruising introduction to cricket’s biggest stage as they suffered a crushing 73-run loss to Scotland on Monday in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland piled up 207-4 with opener George Munsey top-scoring with 84 and in reply, Italy were bowled out for 134 in 16.4 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-spinner Michael Leask took 4-17 for Scotland, adding to his batting cameo of an unbeaten 22 off five balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation better known for its football, Italy are the lowest-ranked side in the 20-team tournament and were making a slice of history here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing a mammoth 208 for victory, they suffered early blows before a valiant fourth-wicket partnership of 73 between Australia-born brothers Ben and Harry Manenti kept them afloat at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020782307871965359&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Harry departed for 37 and Ben got out after his 31-ball 52 as the Italian batting collapsed from 113-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully we’ll sit down at some stage and reflect on that little partnership that we had and it would have been nice to contribute to a win there,” said vice-captain Harry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called playing with his brother “special”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously growing up and playing backyard cricket with him, batting together, and as young kids then dreaming of being at a World Cup batting together and we’ve got to live that out today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa-born captain Wayne Madsen could not bat after he dislocated his shoulder while fielding and might miss the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland skipper Richie Berrington said it was vital for them to bounce back after losing their opening match of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really pleased to get our first win. In the end it was a comprehensive win, but we had to work hard for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland originally failed to qualify for the World Cup but with only two weeks to go, they replaced Bangladesh, who were kicked out after they refused to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#madsen-heartbreak&quot; id=&quot;madsen-heartbreak&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Madsen heartbreak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy won the toss and bowled in the Group C encounter, where there were a few Italian fans decked out in the country’s blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rode on a 126-run opening stand between Munsey and Michael Jones, who hit 37, to post the highest total in the tournament so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon McMullen with an unbeaten 18-ball 41 and Leask, who hit two fours and two sixes in the last five balls, took Scotland to their best T20 World Cup total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Munsey started briskly with a flurry of fours to unsettle Italy’s attack in the first six overs of the powerplay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020766884057190703&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy suffered a blow when Madsen fell awkwardly while trying to stop a boundary in the fourth over and went off the field wincing in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shoulder has been put back in place by the physio but he will undergo scans and is “doubtful” for the rest of the tournament, Italy coach John Davison said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain still completed an unusual World Cup double on Monday — playing in two different sports for two separate countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played at the field hockey World Cup for his native South Africa, but holds an Italian passport now through his ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey, who was dropped on 40 by Anthony Mosca, reached his fifty in 30 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ICC, PCB officials meet in Lahore to discuss Pakistan’s boycotted match with India on Feb 15. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/icc-pcb-officials-meet-in-lahore-to-discuss-pakistans-boycotted-match-with-india-on-feb-15</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level visits come a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kamindu heroics steer Sri Lanka past Ireland in T20 World Cup. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971881/kamindu-heroics-steer-sri-lanka-past-ireland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s 11th-hour call to draft in Kamindu Mendis proved a masterstroke as the all-rounder produced a match-turning cameo to set up a 20-run win over Ireland in their T20 World Cup opener at Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamindu’s blistering 44 off 19 balls with four fours and two sixes gave Sri Lanka the late thrust they badly needed to post 163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin trio of Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga and Dunith Wellalage then ran through the Irish middle order, sharing seven wickets to seal a comfortable victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just wanted to score a few boundaries and put a partnership with Kusal Mendis,” said Kamindu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kusal was outstanding today. He deserves a lot of credit. We wanted someone to bat through the innings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They played well during the run chase until the 15th over. We had to keep our calm and we knew they had to take risks and we bowled well towards the end.” Hasaranga claimed three wickets to take his World Cup tally to 40, second only to Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan, who has 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were anxious moments when the leg-spinner, who has a history with hamstring injuries, limped off after his second over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he returned to complete his quota, he moved gingerly, raising questions over his fitness for the rest of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s innings had been stuck in first gear until Kamindu strode in with the scoreboard reading 86 for four in the 14th over, boundaries having dried up against Ireland’s spinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-hander broke a 57-ball boundary drought with a cheeky reverse sweep and then went into overdrive, plundering 21 runs in the 17th over to wrestle back the momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kusal Mendis playing the sheet anchor role in an unbeaten half-century, Sri Lanka found a competitive total from what had looked like a below-par platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland were marshalled by left-arm spinner George Dockrell, who returned a miserly spell of 2-17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 49-run stand between Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector for the third wicket kept Ireland in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a promising 105 for two, Ireland lost their way and folded for 143 in 19.5 overs with Matheesha Pathirana cleaning up with two wickets in the final over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They got 15 runs too many,” said Ireland captain Paul Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bit sloppy in the field and we have plenty of work to do before the next game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were confident with plenty of wickets in hand, but Sri Lanka held their nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Spin is a challenge for us. It wasn’t coming onto the bat as much as we expected. Spin, I believe, is going to play a big role in this tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former champions Sri Lanka are co-hosting the 20-nation showpiece alongside defending champions India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>As we consider the realities faced by migrants, their power to organise, and the significance of their contributions, it becomes clear that migration is not a problem to be solved but a dynamic process to be understood and respected.</description>

      <title>Israel committed two-thirds of record press killings in 2025: CPJ. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1975665/israel-committed-two-thirds-of-record-press-killings-in-2025-cpj</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A record 129 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide in 2025, the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Wednesday, blaming Israel for two-thirds of the deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the second consecutive annual record for press deaths and the deadliest year since the CPJ began collecting data more than three decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Journalists are being killed in record numbers at a time when access to information is more important than ever,” CEO Jodie Ginsberg said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are all at risk when journalists are killed for reporting the news.” Over three-quarters of all the fatalities in 2025 were in conflict settings, the CPJ said in its report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 60 per cent of the 86 members of the press killed by Israeli fire in 2025 were Palestinians reporting from Gaza, it added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli military claims that it never “deliberately targets” journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of journalists killed in Ukraine and Sudan also increased in 2025 compared to the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPJ highlighted a rise in drones being used, with 39 cases documented, including 28 killings by Israel in Gaza and five by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, four journalists were killed by Russian military drones, the highest annual number of journalist deaths in the war since 15 were killed in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists are increasingly vulnerable due to a persistent culture of impunity, the CPJ said, noting a lack of transparent investigations into killings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mexico, six journalists were killed in 2025, and all the cases remain unsolved. The Philippines saw three journalists shot dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others were killed following their reporting on corruption, such as a Bangladeshi reporter hacked to death by suspects linked to a fraud ring, according to the CPJ report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar organised crime-related deaths were recorded in India and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Saudi Arabia, prominent columnist Turki al-Jasser was executed by the state after being convicted on several charges that the CPJ likened to “spurious national security and financial crime allegations” used to punish reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Gulf state’s first documented killing of a journalist since the 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1523929&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Jamal Khashoggi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trade gap widens 42pc with nine countries to $9bn. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1975357/trade-gap-widens-42pc-with-nine-countries-to-9bn</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s trade deficit with nine regional countries swelled by 41.37 per cent to $9.001 billion in the first seven months (July-January) of FY26, up from $6.367bn in the corresponding period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widening gap reflects a fall in Pakistan’s exports to regional markets, driven largely by reduced shipments to China, followed by Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Trade with Afghanistan, including exports, has remained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964233&quot;&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; since October 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to India posted a slight increase in percentage terms, though the rise was minimal in dollar value. Meanwhile, shipments to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka declined during the period under review, according to the latest figures &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sbp.org.pk/publications/export/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by the State Bank of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade deficit with the nine countries widened by 29.42pc to $12.297bn in FY25 compared to $9.502bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of Pakistan’s exports to the nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — declined by 16.86pc to $2.307bn in 7MFY26 compared to $2.775bn a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FY25, exports to these nine countries recorded a modest increase of 1.49 per cent, rising to $4.401 billion in July to June, up from $4.336 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to this, imports surged 23.69pc to $11.31bn in 7MFY26 from $9.14bn. Imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 24.58pc to $11.097bn in 7MFY26 from $8.907bn over the same period last year. In FY25, imports from China stood at $16.312bn, up by 20.79pc from $13.504bn a year ago. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s exports to China fell by 1.02pc to $1.467bn in 7MFY26 from $1.482bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports from India dipped by 9.44pc to $122.56m in 7MFY26 from $135.35m. In FY25, import from New Delhi increased to $220.58m from $206.89m in the preceding year. Meanwhile, exports remained at $2.926m, slightly increased from $0.404m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Afghanistan dipped 59.07pc to $228.96m in 7MFY26 from $559.52m last year. Imports stood at $6.36m in 7MFY26 against $15.21m in FY25, a plunge of 58.18pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s exports to Bangladesh declined by 10.48pc to $417.62m in 7MFY26 from $466.55m over the last year. In FY25, exports to Dhaka increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m from $661.19m. Imports grew 14.02pc to $42.17m in 7MFY26 from $49.05m over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 28.89pc to $184.48m in 7MFY26 from $259.43m over the last year. The imports from Sri Lanka rose by 11.63pc $38.57m in 7MFY26 from $34.55m over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>South Africa announce eight home Tests for 2026-27. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1975314/south-africa-announce-eight-home-tests-for-2026-27</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CENTURION: World champions South Africa will play eight Test matches at home in the 2026-27 season, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa, who beat Australia in the 2023-25 Test championship final at Lord’s in England last year, did not play a single home Test match during the current 2025-26 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they will play three Tests against Australia, two against Bangladesh and three against England in the coming season with all three series counting towards the 2025-27 World Test Championship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa are currently in third place in the standings after sharing a series 1-1 in Pakistan and beating India 2-0 in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tests against Australia will all be at coastal venues — Durban, Gqeberha and Cape Town — starting on Oct 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh series will be played in Johannesburg and Centurion during November, while England will be the visitors over the holiday period of December-January. The England Tests will be in Johannesburg, Centurion and Cape Town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three tours will also include three-match One-day Internationals series, while Bangladesh will also play three T20 Internationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;England were also due to play a T20 series but it will be rescheduled because of a clash with the SA20 franchise competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSA chief executive Pholetsi Moseki said the Test and ODI series were both particularly important for the South African team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have made a promising start to the new World Test Championship cycle and it is important that we continue to build on that momentum and strengthen our position on the WTC table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On the white-ball front, our focus remains firmly on building towards hosting the ICC men’s Cricket World Cup in 2027. Every ODI series from here forms part of our preparation for that global event.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s home fixtures (2026-27):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia in South Africa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 24: First ODI, Durban&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OICCI seeks to break ‘tax paradox’. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974914/oicci-seeks-to-break-tax-paradox</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has urged the government to immediately freeze all preferential tax treatments — including new exemptions, zero-rating and special regimes — whether introduced through SROs or legislation, unless routed through a fully operational Tax Policy Office (TPO) with a published rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a special report titled Pakistan’s Tax Paradox, the OICCI describes Pakistan’s tax system as one characterised by a narrow tax base and high tax rates, with tax revenues remaining largely stagnant as a share of GDP despite growth in absolute collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It notes that Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio has remained between 9 and 10 per cent for over a decade, although reforms have recently pushed it into double digits, reaching 10.3pc in FY25.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this remains well below international benchmarks. According to the World Bank and the IMF, a tax-to-GDP ratio exceeding 15pc is essential for sustainable growth, poverty reduction and the provision of basic public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report highlights that OECD countries collect taxes equivalent to 34pc of GDP, while the Asia-Pacific average stands at 19.3pc. Pakistan lags behind regional peers such as India (17pc) and Bangladesh (12pc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OICCI recommends that Pakistan’s tax reform agenda be guided by clear outcome targets and disciplined sequencing. It proposes raising the tax-to-GDP ratio from the current 10-12pc range to around 13pc in the short term and above 15pc in the medium term to support growth, strengthen fiscal stability and reduce reliance on debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among its key recommendations, the report calls for immediate operationalisation of the Tax Policy Office as a gatekeeper for all tax changes, along with a clear separation of tax policy from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)’s administrative functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also proposes freezing all preferential treatments, removing arbitrary forms of taxation to minimise refund issues, implementing a structured refund clearance plan, starting with refund-heavy sectors, and adopting a consultative approach in designing and reviewing tax regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also recommends eliminating the super tax under Sections 4B and 4C, reducing the corporate tax rate to 28pc, cutting withholding taxes to 5pc and fixing the maximum salary tax slab at 25pc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asian Development Bank to support AI adoption in Pakistan’s health sector. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974906/asian-development-bank-to-support-ai-adoption-in-pakistans-health-sector</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank will provide technical assistance to Pakistan to enhance understanding and accelerate the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADB has approved regional technical assistance amounting to $950,000 to help Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia reap the benefits of AI for service excellence in health. The assistance will assess AI applications in health promotion, screening, diagnosis, and treatment, and will develop a roadmap for AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governments benefiting from the assistance have requested the ADB to help develop practical AI governance frameworks for anticipated AI innovations, including validation mechanisms, ways to safeguard data privacy and avoid algorithmic bias, and strategies for post-market performance monitoring. These countries are also keen to learn from best practices and use cases for AI tools in clinical care and health management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the ADB had supported member countries investing in digital health, helping them adopt digital health information systems, establish common standards, and improve interoperability, thereby laying a strong foundation for big data analytics and AI applications. The assistance will provide timely support to enhance the AI readiness of member countries’ health systems through technical support and capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bank’s project to assess AI applications in health promotion, screening, diagnosis and treatment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the project document, the assistance will focus on three types of AI applications that are relevant for ADB projects and are becoming mature. First, applications in the clinical context, including AI-assisted smart point-of-care diagnosis and treatment. Advances in image processing and pattern recognition allow medical equipment to become “smart” enough to generate highly accurate diagnoses at the point of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, AI applications in healthcare management aim to improve efficiency and the experience of both patients and health workers. Small hospitals can adopt AI solutions to provide a seamless experience for patients — from appointments, registration, consultations, prescriptions, and treatment to follow-ups — and to help manage patient flow. AI could also automate administrative tasks for health professionals and managers, freeing up time for patient care, improving doctor-patient interaction, and preventing burnout, which is common among health professionals in primary care and hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, generative AI and AI agents could assist in distance learning, medical education, and telemedicine, providing clinical decision support for areas and populations with limited physical access. This could significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of medical education, upskilling of health workers, and public health education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the project document, AI applications have the potential to transform health service organisation and delivery. They could improve the efficiency, quality, and equitable access to healthcare services. AI leveraging big data analytics, deep learning, natural language processing, and robotics could enhance health management, diagnostics, and treatment capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technologies also open new possibilities in rapid drug discovery and personalised medicine. AI can automate record-keeping, claims monitoring, and other administrative tasks; reduce health worker burnout; and enhance efficiency, transparency, and quality of patient-doctor interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical assistance will deliver knowledge to inform the design and implementation of ADB projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan. It will survey available AI tools in healthcare and help member countries develop roadmaps for home-grown AI ecosystems that integrate considerations for research and development, technology transfer, commercialization, and procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADB notes that intensified geopolitics, economic uncertainties, and major shifts in the global health aid landscape have constrained the investments needed to improve health outcomes. Governments continue to face gaps in health infrastructure, equipment bottlenecks, mal-distribution of qualified health human resources, insufficient funding to upskill and incentivise health workers, escalating health expenditure, and the proliferation of fragmented and non-interoperable digital health applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Absorbing population growth. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974737/absorbing-population-growth</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;FINALLY, the debate about whether rapid population growth is beneficial or pernicious for the economy appears to be settled. While the evidence was extensive and categorical, it has taken several decades for the numbers to be absorbed by our leading economists. In the meantime, we have potentially lost billions of dollars in GDP, experienced the tragedy of several thousand maternal and child deaths, and seen a decline in per capita income as the cost of not pursuing sound population policies and actions to bring down our rapid population growth rate. While all our neighbours, most prominently Bangladesh, took clear and purposeful steps, we have complacently accepted high and even rising population growth rates since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus created at DawnMedia’s &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUNr-LEZxTWbD3UcLWdAvL5EHJZFrRWFCTRsF-4UGt4/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paki­stan Population Summit&lt;/a&gt; last December confirmed several truths. First and foremost is that economic growth and prosperity for Pakistan are impossible under current demographic trends. High fertility and population growth rates are eating into an already low economic growth, resulting in greater poverty and income inequalities. There is categorical evidence that larger households with more dependents save less, spend less on education and eat lower-quality food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the expectation of a demographic dividend due to the surge in the working population is an elusive dream. In fact, this dream has been shattered by growing unemployment figures and a rising gap in the ability to generate employment to keep up with the millions of youth entering the labour force each year. The finance minister has publicly admitted that it is next to impossible, as not enough jobs are being generated to keep pace with the forecasted surge in the working-age population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it was proclaimed that urbanisation would be the engine of growth and generate employment. However, it has been pointed out by &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org/topics_population-policy/21/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pakistan@2050&lt;/a&gt; that structural changes are required to produce more jobs. Rapid urbanisation is being led by a push out of agriculture in rural areas to escape poverty, and not as a pull factor in search of better jobs. In fact, additional jobs in new sectors only provide minimal employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit brought together a wide spectrum of participants and speakers, generating some optimism that we have turned the corner on population issues. Foremost, a media house took the initiative of organising a summit on population. Another prominent media house has just launched the Waqfa campaign to raise awareness and change behaviour. Much of this positivity is the outcome of the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nam-Fw4f8AxJWOwIVBdqGPfl0GafIDG7/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Council of Islamic Ideology&lt;/a&gt; and Population Council consultation on the concept of tawazun (balance) and birth spacing last year. This declaration has been endorsed by 37 prominent ulema supporting family planning and birth spacing for improved outcomes for mothers, children and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations of a demographic dividend due to the surge in working numbers are misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hopeful sign is the unusual cross-party support for the national issue of tackling high population growth rates. The Parliamentary Forum for Population has had successful meetings over five years, discussing resource-sharing around population. Forum members passed a unanimous &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmdk7nFLzPSUU6Dk-gVa0oFkjrBu3926/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; in parliament last August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a consensus has emerged, why is there very little action at the national or provincial level that reflects a commitment to lowering population growth on an urgent and priority basis? This is not to undermine efforts and statements issued periodically by the provincial and federal leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to act is immediate. There is no time for piecemeal efforts or waiting for the provinces to reach the same level of capacity and concern regarding this daunting challenge. The federal government should take the first step and become the dominant partner. It must demonstrate intent, moving beyond statements: theirs should be a policy setting and coordination role with the provinces and regions. Larger provinces, such as Punjab and Sindh, can generate their initiatives, but less-resourced provinces and regions definitely require supplemental funds from the centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finance minister has been most consistent and prominent in publicly expressing that population growth is not just an impediment but an existential crisis for Pakistan. Creating the financing and resources to balance population concerns, especially in the most challenging, poorest, remotest and vulnerable parts of the country, must be his ministry’s priority. Direct financing for districts that are most vulnerable and lack the basics, preventing millions of households from accessing education, health and family planning, has to become as much of a priority as other financing reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Benazir Income Support Programme is renowned as one of the largest social protection programmes in the world. It is centred on women. Unwanted pregnancies affect the poorest women most directly, as do unwanted and mistimed births, which are not within their control. A cash transfer programme must be launched that enables poorer households to access family planning services. This programme would follow the same rationale as providing income support to women living in the poorest households through BISP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poorest women, when able to fulfil their unmet needs, will provide for improved health outcomes for families and create an economically powerful impetus for improving household welfare. It will present a programme that enables millions to benefit from improving other outcomes — such as their own health, household savings and children’s investments — and trigger a new turnaround dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the federal government must activate and announce the CCI mandated population fund. This population fund should be well-resourced and function under the finance ministry; it would be used to award grants to provinces and regions for additional family planning services. Grants can be directly linked with performance in improving health and related outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a growing consensus that population concerns will not be solved without improving educational outcomes, particularly for women and girls. The most powerful way of empowering women is through education and skills, but especially through paid work, by ensuring their safety, mobility and employability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is heartening that the public conversation has shifted towards putting women in the driving seat. It is high time that women’s empowerment is seen as a solution to unlocking greater economic growth by tapping into work and earnings potential and reaping the benefits of increased household savings and positive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The writer is Country Director, Population Council.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan to tour Bangladesh next month for a 3-match ODI series. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974595/pakistan-to-tour-bangladesh-next-month-for-a-3-match-odi-series</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday that the Green Shirts would tour Bangladesh in March for a three-match One Day International (ODI) series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/TheRealPCB/status/2024841594105729405&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the PCB said, “Pakistan men’s cricket team will tour Bangladesh for a three-match ODI series, the Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed on Friday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said that the team would arrive in Bangladesh on March 9 and hold a training session the next day, ahead of the opening ODI against the hosts on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-4/5  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCB/status/2024841594105729405?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board added that the second ODI would be played on March 13, while the third and final match was scheduled for March 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that all three matches would be played at the Shere Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This will be Pakistan’s second tour of Bangladesh since July 2025. Pakistan last toured Bangladesh for a three-match T20I series in July, which the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1925946&quot;&gt;hosts won 2-1&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Bangladesh toured Pakistan for a three-match T20I series in May/June last year, which the Salman Ali Agha-led side &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1914787&quot;&gt;won 3-0&lt;/a&gt;,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes after Pakistan announced it would boycott the match against India during the ongoing T20 World Cup. The decision came after Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969924&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to shift its matches out of India was rejected amid tensions between the two countries, which led to the team being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced &lt;/a&gt;by Scotland in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation ultimately led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;delegation &lt;/a&gt;from the International Cricket Council visiting Pakistan, after which it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;that Pakistan would play the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the ICC also announced that Bangladesh would not face any penalty for opting out of the tournament and would also host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The biggest challenges that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has to tackle following its recent victory in the general election are the country’s sluggish economy, high inflation and unemployment.
Speaking at a webinar, panellists said voters would judge the new government on its ability to create jobs, tame inflation and steady relations with key partners, even as they commended the peaceful election.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;However, a balanced assessment suggests that India’s superpower trajectory could also generate opportunities for Bangladesh. Enhanced regional connectivity, expanded market access, greater investment flows, and improved regional stability could benefit Dhaka—provided cooperation and mutual respect remain central to bilateral engagement. Ultimately, the impact on Bangladesh will depend not only on India’s power trajectory but also on how both countries manage diplomacy, trust-building, and regional cooperation in an evolving geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Muslims around the world continue to observe Ramazan with devotion and unity, as communities gather for prayers, reflection, and acts of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosques resonate with nightly Taraweeh prayers, and charitable initiatives reach their peak as believers support those in need. Here are some glimpses from different countries, including Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Palestine, Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Pakistan is busting the Great Power monopoly on air power. [ responsiblestatecraft ]</title>
      <link>https://responsiblestatecraft.org/pakistan-air-force-fighter-jets/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media-library/jf-17-thunder-jet-fighter-pakistan.jpg?id=64965159&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=600&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C117%2C0%2C118&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a familiar refrain heard through the packed halls of the Munich Security Conference this year — soliloquies on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/10/europe/trump-munich-security-conference-report-intl-hnk&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;decades-long prosperous international order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” now under unprecedented strain. The gathering, as ever, was an echo chamber of transatlantic anxiety, tinged with denial about the steady unraveling of Western primacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of miles away, however, a more consequential transformation is unfolding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the&lt;a href=&quot;https://nastp.gov.pk/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Aerospace Science and Technology Park&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(NASTP) in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, visitors moved through halls lined with scaled-down models of fighter jets and combat drones, pausing at flight simulators where students honed their skills, and observed engineers guiding startups through prototype development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than an industrial showcase, NASTP captured a structural shift reshaping global security, as airpower is steadily democratized and credible aerial capability passes from the monopoly of wealthy Western states into the hands of emerging powers in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the modern era, scenes like this would have been unthinkable outside a narrow circle of elite powers. Advanced airpower demanded massive defense budgets, well-developed technological ecosystems, and political alignment with Western security networks that controlled access to cutting-edge aircraft, avionics and precision weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air superiority became the strategic privilege of close U.S. allies, the Soviet Union/Russia, and the handful of wealthy states able to sustain the financial and diplomatic costs of maintaining modern fleets. Export controls, sanctions regimes and political conditionalities ensured that control of the skies remained tightly guarded. Today, however, that long-standing monopoly is steadily eroding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this monopoly was U.S. control of the F-16, one of the most coveted fighter aircraft of the Cold War. Produced by General Dynamics, the multirole jet combined air-to-air combat capability with precision strike, a versatility it demonstrated in 1981 when Israeli F-16s destroyed &lt;a href=&quot;https://shafaq.com/en/Report/Israel-s-raid-on-Osirak-as-a-brave-new-world-JP-reported&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the F-16 became the geopolitical reward for serving as Washington’s frontline ally in expelling the Soviets from Afghanistan after 1980, while its rival India remained largely dependent on Soviet aircraft during the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and increasing tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan after 2001, led to a strategic regional realignment in South Asian arms procurement, and the erosion of Western dominance over advanced airpower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift became impossible to ignore when Washington moved in 2020 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2020/08/12/congress-has-secretly-blocked-us-arms-sales-to-turkey-for-nearly-two-years/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;block fellow NATO-member Turkey from acquiring advanced F-16 upgrades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following Ankara’s purchase of Russia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/turkeys-missile-dilemma-choice-between-russia-and-us&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;advanced S-400 missile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; air defense system. The decision exposed how even close allies remain vulnerable to Western export controls. Ankara responded by accelerating its indigenous drone program, producing low-cost, combat-proven platforms that would soon reshape battlefields from Ukraine and the Caucasus to the Middle East and Africa, a transformation catalyzed and accelerated by the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Pakistan and China advanced the JF-17. The name of the affordable jet took a swipe at its Western competitors, with “JF” standing for “Joint Fighter” and the number 17 suggesting an upgrade over the F-16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's willingness to transfer technology and co-produce advanced systems enabled Pakistan to field a modern multirole fighter capable of shooting down aircraft with beyond-visual-range missiles, delivering precision-guided munitions against ground targets and tracking multiple threats through its active electronically scanned array radar. Together, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/turkey-plans-drone-facility-in-pakistan-in-global-defense-push?embedded-checkout=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turkish combat drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the JF-17 have shattered the exclusivity of airpower, dismantling the financial and political barriers that long restricted credible aerial capability to a narrow circle of privileged states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, this transformation has been both strategic and reputational. Co-developed with China and increasingly produced domestically, the JF-17 anchors Islamabad’s shift from arms importer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2026/02/pakistans-burgeoning-arms-industry-strategic-opportunity-us/411168/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;aerospace power broker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That evolution gained global visibility during the four-day conflict last May, when Pakistani aircraft allegedly downed the Indian Rafale aircraft purchased from the French firm Dassault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That success generated international attention and drew rare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972507&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;public praise from U.S. President Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sharply boosting interest in the aircraft. Since then, the JF-17’s export footprint has expanded across Nigeria, Myanmar, Azerbaijan, and Iraq, with interest growing across Africa, the Middle East, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/9/why-is-pakistan-selling-its-jf-17-fighter-jets-to-bangladesh-and-others&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By offering a capable, affordable alternative to Western and Russian fighters, Pakistan is reshaping procurement choices for mid-tier states. In doing so, it is no longer merely buying security but it is increasingly enabling it, positioning itself as a strategic node in a rapidly diversifying global defense ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this shift extend beyond arms markets, as smaller and mid-tier states acquire credible airpower for the first time and regional hierarchies flatten and deterrence relationships recalibrate. In volatile regions from South Asia to the Middle East and the Caucasus, this diffusion of airpower is fundamentally altering how influence, coercion, and stability are negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For mid-tier powers, the war in Ukraine showed that without effective airpower, maneuver alone cannot deliver decisive battlefield outcomes. Instead, it drives conflicts toward attritional stalemate and forces a reassessment of force structure and operational concepts,” observes Lt Col Steen Kjaergaard from the Royal Danish Defence College, Denmark, who has closely followed the war in Ukraine to study the battlefields of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at NASTP in Rawalpindi, the objective is not merely to manufacture aircraft, but to cultivate human capital and technological depth underpinning long-term strategic autonomy. By embedding aerospace development within an entrepreneurial framework, Pakistan is laying the groundwork for enduring defense sovereignty, ensuring that its growing airpower is supported by indigenous skills, research capacity and industrial resilience rather than perpetual external dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Air Marshal (Ret.) Aamir Masood, who served in the Pakistan Air Force for over 40 years, “Aerospace [is likely to] remain as a weapon of choice for future leadership.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that the future “is all about non-contact warfare with beyond visual range precise ammunition, swarming drones and combat unmanned vehicles assisted by Artificial Intelligence based algorithms Decision support tools (DSTs). A country with better integration and networking would be able to have a faster OODA (Observe- Orientate- Decide- Act).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative effect is a reshaping of the global balance of military power. Western dominance of defense markets is weakening as a new cohort of arms exporters led by Turkey, Pakistan and China is redefining access to advanced aerial capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not only about cheaper alternatives. These states offer new solutions for markets confined by the political conditionality, or export mechanisms imposed by the Western world. This change is especially appealing in the Global South, eroding the domination of Western suppliers over elevated military capabilities,” said Flavius Caba-Maria, President of the Middle East Political and Economic Institute in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more states acquire affordable fighters and combat drones, deterrence relationships are shifting and regional competitions are intensifying, injecting both stability and volatility into fragile security environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The democratization of airpower does not automatically produce peace. Instead, it redistributes leverage, accelerates arms races and complicates strategic calculations. It also signals the arrival of a genuinely multipolar military order, in which technological capability is no longer the exclusive domain of a few privileged states. This transformation is unfolding in real time, redrawing the geopolitical map of the skies and, with it, the nature of air power itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee meets in Peshawar for Ramazan moon sighting. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974092/central-ruet-i-hilal-committee-meets-in-peshawar-for-ramazan-moon-sighting</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee is currently underway in Peshawar to sight the Ramazan moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee chairman, Maulana Syed Muhammad Abdul Khabir Azad, is presiding over the meeting at the Auqaf Department building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zonal and district Ruet-i-Hilal Committees in Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore and other cities have also gathered to sight the new moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, according to the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/ramadan-begins-tomorrow-moon-sighted-4109261&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the crescent moon was sighted in Bangladesh, meaning that the first day of the holy month would be observed on Thursday (February 19).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, based on the moon’s expected age, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972917&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that the first day of Ramazan was “likely to fall” on February 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Suparco said the final announcement regarding the beginning of the holy month would be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, “which is the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Afghanistan observed their first day of fasting on Wednesday after the crescent moon was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973918/ramazan-moon-sighted-in-saudi-arabia-uae&quot;&gt;sighted&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced a Rs38 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973178&quot;&gt;Ramazan Relief Package&lt;/a&gt; for 12.1 million deserving families across the four provinces as well as Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every deserving family will receive Rs13,000 through a digital wallet or bank transfer, without discrimination based on party affiliation or point of view,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nearly 100 states, 3 blocs slam West Bank ‘annexation’. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974013/nearly-100-states-3-blocs-slam-west-bank-annexation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Nations from Algeria to Zimbabwe, Arab League, OIC and EU take issue with unilateral decisions aimed at expanding unlawful Israeli presence&lt;br /&gt;• Israeli NGO warns against expansion of settlements ‘into Jerusalem’&lt;br /&gt;• Imam of Al Aqsa barred from entering mosque compound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM: As Israeli authorities barred the imam of Al Aqsa Mosque from entering the compound, 93 states — including the eight-nation Muslim bloc — slammed Tel Aviv’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973604&quot;&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; to designate lands in the occupied West Bank as so-called “state land”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Israeli cabinet approved measures that would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli NGOs have also raised alarm over the government’s settlement plan, which they say would mark the first expansion of Jerusalem’s borders into the occupied West Bank since 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement, issued by the Palestinian mission to the United Nations, 85 nations as well as the European Union (EU), Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Arab League called for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States who signed up to the latest statement include Algeria, Andorra, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, North Korea, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Liberia, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, South Korea, Russia, San Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, The Gambia, Turkiye, Uganda, UAE, Tanzania, UK, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen and Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier statement from the foreign ministers of the eight-nation Muslim bloc also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973896&quot;&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; Israel for approving procedures for the registration and settlement of land ownership across extensive areas of the occupied West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This illegal step constitutes a grave escalation aimed at accelerating illegal settlement activity, land confiscation, entrenching Israeli control, and applying unlawful Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” said the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This step reflects an attempt to impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land, thereby undermining the two-state solution, eroding the prospects for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State, and jeopardising the attainment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning by NGOs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned development, announced by Israel’s Ministry of Construction and Housing, is formally a westward expansion of the Geva Binyamin, or Adam, settlement situated north-east of Jerusalem in the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the area to be developed lies on the Israeli side of the separation barrier built in the early 2000s, while Geva Binyamin sits on the West Bank side of the barrier, and the two are separated by a road. In a statement, Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now said there would be no “territorial or functional connection” between the area to be developed and the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The new neighbourhood will be integral to the city of Jerusalem,” said Lior Amihai, Peace Now’s executive director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is unique about that one is that it will be connected directly to Jerusalem, but it will be beyond the annexed municipal border. So it will be in complete West Bank territory, but just adjacent to Jerusalem,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imam barred from Al Aqsa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Muhammad Al-Abbasi, a senior imam of the Al Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem, said on Tuesday that Israeli authorities had barred him from entering the compound, just days before the start of the holy month of Ramazan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have been barred from the mosque for a week, and the order can be renewed,” he said, adding that he was not informed of the reason for the ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Israeli police said they had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PAF’s participation in Saudi defence expo reinforces Pakistan’s position as ‘emerging hub of aerospace innovation’. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972255/pafs-participation-in-saudi-defence-expo-reinforces-pakistans-position-as-emerging-hub-of-aerospace-innovation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;JF-17&lt;/a&gt; Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967005&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024. Azerbaijan had become the third country to acquire JF-17 fighters after Myanmar and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COAS Munir lauds ‘character, courage, competence’ shown by soldiers in ongoing fight against terrorism. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972253/coas-munir-lauds-character-courage-competence-shown-by-soldiers-in-ongoing-fight-against-terrorism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded the “character, courage, and competence” demonstrated by soldiers in the ongoing fight against terrorism, the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an ISPR &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7615&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the CDF made these remarks while addressing the closing ceremony of the 9th International Pakistan Army Team Spirit (PATS) Competition as the chief guest on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming the core values of the army, the CDF “underscored the enduring soldierly attributes of ‘character, courage and competence’, which have been consistently demonstrated by Pakistani soldiers, particularly in the ongoing fight against terrorism”, the military’s media wing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field Marshal Munir also “commended all participating teams for their exceptional professionalism, physical and mental endurance, operational competence and high morale displayed during the exercise”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He emphasised the importance of such multinational engagements in enhancing collective preparedness and adapting to the evolving character of modern warfare,” the press release added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISPR described PATS Competition as a 60-hour-long patrolling exercise, designed to “enhance professional military skills through the exchange of innovative ideas, tactical experiences and best practices among participating teams”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise, held from February 5 to 9, was carried out in the semi-mountainous terrain of Punjab, “providing a realistic and challenging operational environment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the years, PATS has evolved into a prestigious and highly competitive military exercise, recognised for promoting professional excellence and mutual learning among participating nations,” the statement noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affirmed that the forum “continues to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and understanding, while fostering camaraderie and team spirit in a demanding operational setting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s PATS Competition featured 19 countries — including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, the United States of America, and Uzbekistan — while Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand attended the exercise as observers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 16 domestic teams from the army and the navy, along with observers from the air force, also participated in the event, ISPR stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDF also presented awards to the outstanding participants of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“International observers and defence attachés from participating countries also attended the event and expressed appreciation for high standard of professionalism, organisation, and conduct demonstrated throughout the exercise,” the press release read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the CDF also witnessed miscellaneous training activities at the National Counter Terrorism Centre in Pabbi, including a visit to the newly established Tactical Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lauded the efforts of troops and the technical team and emphasised the importance of simulator-based training to complement traditional training methods, ISPR said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh poll race heats up on final day of campaigning. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972185/bangladesh-poll-race-heats-up-on-final-day-of-campaigning</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Tens of thousands of supporters attend rival rallies across Dhaka&lt;br /&gt;• Voters will elect lawmakers to a 350-seat parliament&lt;br /&gt;• BNP, led by Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique, widely seen as a frontrunner&lt;br /&gt;• BNP’s main rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Shafiqur Rahman, allied with the student-led National Citizen Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat parliament, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — led by Tarique Rahman, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; in December after 17 years in exile — widely tipped as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s key rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party that is led by Shafiqur Rahman and has allied with the National Citizen Party (NCP) that was formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Justice’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Long live the revolution’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 10 - China’s influence in Bangladesh, boosted by the 2024 ouster of New Delhi‑aligned leader Sheikh Hasina, is likely to deepen after this week's election, although politicians and analysts say India is too large a neighbour to be sidelined completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PSL franchise Multan Sultans sold for record Rs2.45bn; new owner says name will be changed to Rawalpindi. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972074/psl-franchise-multan-sultans-sold-for-record-rs245bn-new-owner-says-name-will-be-changed-to-rawalpindi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Super League franchise (PSL) Multan Sultans on Monday was sold to Walee Technologies for a record Rs2.45 billion ahead of the tournament’s 11th edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the auction in Lahore, show host Fakhr-i-Alam informed bidders that the winning bid would also cover the annual fee to maintain ownership of the team for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MultanSultans/status/2020864897551106059&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the auction ceremony, the new owner of the team announced that they would be changing the name to Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you ready for a surprise? We will be going for Rawalpindi!” announced the company’s chief executive officer, Ahsan Tahir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the ceremony, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated Walee Technologies on their successful bid and expressed gratitude to former board chairman Najam Sethi for his vision for the Multan Sultans franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This Multan Sultans was created by Najam Sethi &lt;em&gt;sahib&lt;/em&gt; and the person who started this journey; we are so pleased he is with us today,” Naqvi said, inviting Sethi onto the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Sethi said, “I’m obviously delighted to be here; this is the culmination of a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m obviously over the moon that it’s come through under Mohsin Naqvi, who is a dear, dear friend of mine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sethi hailed the winning bid as a “great moment for Pakistan cricket”, adding that Naqvi would give good news “beyond PSL” over the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, at a press conference with representatives from Walee Technologies, Naqvi said that the future of the Multan Sultans brand would have to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot ask the person paying Rs2.45bn to keep the name Multan Sultans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we discussed auctioning Multan Sultans, we planned to keep it for one or two years. But there was a good environment in the market and we were already auctioning five or six teams,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB chief noted that there were concerns, given the brand’s age and the possibility of damage to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, Multan Sultans is very close to my heart, so we will come up with a solution,” Naqvi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about the criteria for setting the opening bid at Rs1.82bn, he replied that it was the second-highest bid for the Sialkot team, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965821&quot;&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; for Rs1.85bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a question about ongoing meetings with a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pakistan’s boycott of the match with India in the T20 World Cup, Naqvi replied, “The issue was Bangladesh’s. We did not want to let their point of view go; they are our brothers and you saw the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things are happening, which is why I won’t say much, but the ICC and the Bangladesh board are in that phase where if I say anything, it won’t be right. We’ll update you once we receive information,” the PCB chief said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said that “guests need to be respected” when asked about the attitude of the visiting ICC delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walee Technologies is a global company specialising in projects in the media, finance and technology sectors, according to their &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://walee.pk/about-walee/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which added that the company had also earlier acquired PSL livestreaming rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise, started in 2017 under the name Multan Sultans, competed in eight consecutive editions of the PSL, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1631329&quot;&gt;winning &lt;/a&gt;the league in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, the franchise was left &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957302&quot;&gt;ownerless &lt;/a&gt;after the PCB did not extend a renewal offer to owner Ali Khan Tareen. The PCB then announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963738&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;take over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the franchise for the upcoming tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bids were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966930&quot;&gt;invited &lt;/a&gt;on January 14 and their technical evaluation was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970696&quot;&gt;completed &lt;/a&gt;by February 3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scotland spoil Italy’s T20 World Cup debut with big win. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972064/scotland-spoil-italys-t20-world-cup-debut-with-big-win</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;T20 World Cup debutants Italy had a bruising introduction to cricket’s biggest stage as they suffered a crushing 73-run loss to Scotland on Monday in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland piled up 207-4 with opener George Munsey top-scoring with 84 and in reply, Italy were bowled out for 134 in 16.4 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-spinner Michael Leask took 4-17 for Scotland, adding to his batting cameo of an unbeaten 22 off five balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation better known for its football, Italy are the lowest-ranked side in the 20-team tournament and were making a slice of history here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing a mammoth 208 for victory, they suffered early blows before a valiant fourth-wicket partnership of 73 between Australia-born brothers Ben and Harry Manenti kept them afloat at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020782307871965359&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Harry departed for 37 and Ben got out after his 31-ball 52 as the Italian batting collapsed from 113-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully we’ll sit down at some stage and reflect on that little partnership that we had and it would have been nice to contribute to a win there,” said vice-captain Harry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called playing with his brother “special”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously growing up and playing backyard cricket with him, batting together, and as young kids then dreaming of being at a World Cup batting together and we’ve got to live that out today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa-born captain Wayne Madsen could not bat after he dislocated his shoulder while fielding and might miss the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland skipper Richie Berrington said it was vital for them to bounce back after losing their opening match of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really pleased to get our first win. In the end it was a comprehensive win, but we had to work hard for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland originally failed to qualify for the World Cup but with only two weeks to go, they replaced Bangladesh, who were kicked out after they refused to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#madsen-heartbreak&quot; id=&quot;madsen-heartbreak&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Madsen heartbreak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy won the toss and bowled in the Group C encounter, where there were a few Italian fans decked out in the country’s blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rode on a 126-run opening stand between Munsey and Michael Jones, who hit 37, to post the highest total in the tournament so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon McMullen with an unbeaten 18-ball 41 and Leask, who hit two fours and two sixes in the last five balls, took Scotland to their best T20 World Cup total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Munsey started briskly with a flurry of fours to unsettle Italy’s attack in the first six overs of the powerplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy suffered a blow when Madsen fell awkwardly while trying to stop a boundary in the fourth over and went off the field wincing in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shoulder has been put back in place by the physio but he will undergo scans and is “doubtful” for the rest of the tournament, Italy coach John Davison said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain still completed an unusual World Cup double on Monday — playing in two different sports for two separate countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played at the field hockey World Cup for his native South Africa, but holds an Italian passport now through his ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey, who was dropped on 40 by Anthony Mosca, reached his fifty in 30 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey missed out on a hundred after he holed out to long-on off pace bowler Grant Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hit 13 fours and two sixes in his 54-ball knock to lead Scotland to their first group win, after they lost their first match to the West Indies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ICC, PCB officials meet in Lahore to discuss Pakistan’s boycotted match with India on Feb 15. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/icc-pcb-officials-meet-in-lahore-to-discuss-pakistans-boycotted-match-with-india-on-feb-15</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level visits come a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kamindu heroics steer Sri Lanka past Ireland in T20 World Cup. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971881/kamindu-heroics-steer-sri-lanka-past-ireland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s 11th-hour call to draft in Kamindu Mendis proved a masterstroke as the all-rounder produced a match-turning cameo to set up a 20-run win over Ireland in their T20 World Cup opener at Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamindu’s blistering 44 off 19 balls with four fours and two sixes gave Sri Lanka the late thrust they badly needed to post 163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin trio of Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga and Dunith Wellalage then ran through the Irish middle order, sharing seven wickets to seal a comfortable victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just wanted to score a few boundaries and put a partnership with Kusal Mendis,” said Kamindu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kusal was outstanding today. He deserves a lot of credit. We wanted someone to bat through the innings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They played well during the run chase until the 15th over. We had to keep our calm and we knew they had to take risks and we bowled well towards the end.” Hasaranga claimed three wickets to take his World Cup tally to 40, second only to Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan, who has 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were anxious moments when the leg-spinner, who has a history with hamstring injuries, limped off after his second over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he returned to complete his quota, he moved gingerly, raising questions over his fitness for the rest of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s innings had been stuck in first gear until Kamindu strode in with the scoreboard reading 86 for four in the 14th over, boundaries having dried up against Ireland’s spinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-hander broke a 57-ball boundary drought with a cheeky reverse sweep and then went into overdrive, plundering 21 runs in the 17th over to wrestle back the momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kusal Mendis playing the sheet anchor role in an unbeaten half-century, Sri Lanka found a competitive total from what had looked like a below-par platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland were marshalled by left-arm spinner George Dockrell, who returned a miserly spell of 2-17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 49-run stand between Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector for the third wicket kept Ireland in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a promising 105 for two, Ireland lost their way and folded for 143 in 19.5 overs with Matheesha Pathirana cleaning up with two wickets in the final over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They got 15 runs too many,” said Ireland captain Paul Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bit sloppy in the field and we have plenty of work to do before the next game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were confident with plenty of wickets in hand, but Sri Lanka held their nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Spin is a challenge for us. It wasn’t coming onto the bat as much as we expected. Spin, I believe, is going to play a big role in this tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former champions Sri Lanka are co-hosting the 20-nation showpiece alongside defending champions India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A new report highlights concerns over rising Islamist politics in Bangladesh after the July 2024 uprising. Researchers suggest this shift could negatively affect women and minorities. The analysis indicates a move towards right-wing ideology, with previously suppressed Islamist groups gaining prominence. This transition may introduce formal and informal Islamic governance, posing challenges for women's rights in the country.</description>

      <description>Controversial remarks in Bangladesh by a politician who questioned women’s ability to perform jobs because of their child-bearing role have caused an uproar ahead of the general election in a country where female workers form the spine of its mainstay garment sector.

      <title>Bangladesh keen on buying rolling stocks. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971817/bangladesh-keen-on-buying-rolling-stocks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Bangladesh has expressed keen interest in procuring freight wagons and passenger coaches after Pakistan offered the rolling stock at prices cheaper than those in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-member delegation, headed by a senior Bangladeshi official, has also visited the Pakistan Railways (PR) carriage factory in Islamabad and the Mughalpura Workshop in Lahore to receive a briefing from the railway authorities and to witness the rolling stock manufacturing process, &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; has learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Lahore-based PR authorities, Mr Farhad Islam, Bangladesh’s Secretary for International Organisations and Consular Affairs and Designate D-8 Commissioner and Mohammad Iqbal Hussain Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan, visited the Mughalpura workshop on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Nasir Khalili, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Carriage and Wagons), briefed the delegation on the overall functioning, technical capabilities, and ongoing projects of the PR’s workshops. A short documentary highlighting the workshops’ operational and working strengths was also shown to the guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shepherd takes hat-trick as West Indies beat Scotland in T20 World Cup. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971704/shepherd-takes-hat-trick-as-west-indies-beat-scotland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pace bowler Romario Shepherd took the first hat-trick of the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup on Saturday to help the West Indies blow away Scotland’s tail and win by 35 runs in their Group C opener in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd grabbed a sensational four wickets in five balls in the 17th over to put an end to Scotland’s hopes of chasing their target of 183.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimron Hetmyer’s 36-ball 64 at Eden Gardens earlier propelled the West Indies to 182-5 in their 20 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots, who only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971513/excited-scots-out-to-prove-they-deserve-last-minute-call-up&quot;&gt;received &lt;/a&gt;a call-up two weeks ago to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, were threatening a famous victory at 114-3 at the end of the 13th over, with big-hitting captain Richie Berrington and Tom Bruce at the crease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 78-run fourth-wicket partnership between Berrington, who made 42, and Tom Bruce (35) had put them back in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But strikes by Jason Holder and then Shepherd’s burst saw Scotland bowled out for 147.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sheppie, he is one of those guys who is willing to learn and improve,” West Indies captain Shai Hope told reporters. “He is always willing to put his hand up, whatever the team requires of him, whether with bat or ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is kind of versatile for us in the middle overs, and it’s good to see him starting the tournament with a bang, and hopefully he will continue doing the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd removed Matthew Cross, for 11, Michael Leask and Oliver Davidson and celebrated wildly before ending with an impressive 5-20 from his three overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holder finished with figures of 3-30 in 3.5 overs as he wrapped up the Scotland innings in 18.5 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s obviously been great to get a feel for the conditions here,” said Berrington, whose side have a quick turnaround as they face Italy at the same ground on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So I’d say there’s definitely a lot of positives we can take from today. And we need to take that into our next game in a couple of days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; id=&quot;six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Six-hitting Hetmyer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots won the toss and elected to field and initially had the West Indies on the back foot with some disciplined bowling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opener Brandon King made 35 as he cut loose in the seventh over to hit pace bowler Safyaan Sharif for a six and two fours off successive balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rotated their bowlers and Leask struck the first blow with his off-spin as he bowled Hope for 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King was out next, falling to debutant left-arm spinner Davidson, caught at backward point for his maiden T20 wicket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Hetmyer took on the opposition attack, hitting six sixes in all, and put on a stand of 81 off 37 balls with Rovman Powell, who made 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer, who was named player of the match, reached his fifty off 22 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell was dismissed, but he kept up the attack with fellow left-hander Sherfane Rutherford, who scored a 13-ball 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer fell to Sharif with Brandon McMullen taking a stunning catch at long-on and Rutherford followed him on the first ball of the next over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-arm pace bowler Brad Currie returned figures of 2-23.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ICC in talks to revive India-Pakistan T20 World Cup clash. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971692/icc-in-talks-to-revive-india-pakistan-t20-world-cup-clash</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) is in talks with the Pakistan Cricket Board to resolve the boycott of its T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; learnt on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsor and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fixture was thrown into doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) reached out to the ICC after a formal communication from the cricket world body, a source close to the developments told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC was seeking a resolution through dialogue and not confrontation, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968499&quot;&gt;refused &lt;/a&gt;to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced &lt;/a&gt;by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a protest, Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;edged out Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said this week that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Excited’ Scots out to prove they deserve last-minute call-up. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971513/excited-scots-out-to-prove-they-deserve-last-minute-call-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KOLKATA: Scotland spinner Mark Watt said on Friday they were confident of proving they belong at the T20 World Cup, despite only being an eleventh-hour replacement for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots failed originally to qualify for the tournament in India and Sri Lanka, but their late call-up will see them face two-time winners the West Indies in Kolkata on Saturday after having only a few days to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh refused to play in India, citing security concerns, and were replaced by the International Cricket Council with Scotland being named as replacement less than two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a frantic dash to India they will also face England, Italy and Nepal in Group ‘C’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Richie Berrington-captained team are determined to make the most of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, firstly, we’re very sympathetic towards Bangladeshi players, but we still massively believe that we should be here,” veteran left-armer Watt told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe that we can beat tea­ms higher ranked than us. So there’s no second guess in our invite into this tournament. We’re all ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scotland will make their fifth consecutive appearance at the T20 World Cup with their best showing in 2021 when they reached the Super 12 stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots stunned the West Indies in the 2022 edition and Watt said they can do it again at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re definitely going out there to win,” the 29-year-old said. “We’ve beaten them twice very recently, so I don’t see why we can’t do it again. We’re very confident.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watt said they had received huge support after being parachuted into the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To be honest, if I had to wrap it all up in one word, it’d just be excitement,” he said of the mood in the team camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, how more excited could they be?  They were sitting in their house doing nothing 10 days ago and now they’re in India at a World Cup.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watt added that being fresh and rested could work in Scotland’s favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know, we’ve had a great week here in India and sometimes actually having a break from the game is a good thing,” said Watt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you can overthink too much about, oh, we’re playing against England, we’re playing against West Indies.” Berrington said it had been a whirlwind couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Obviously it has been unique circumstances,” Berrington told reporters at the captains’ press conference in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There has been a quick turnaround for us. Our preparations probably looked slightly different to some of the other teams. But I think we have been presen­ted with a great opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed between the European Union (EU) and India a week back and the reduction of US reciprocal tariff on India from 50 per cent to only 18 per cent have evidently heightened concerns in Bangladesh about safeguarding its trade preferences in the two major export markets</description>

      <title>Why Pakistan’s squad at this year’s T20 world Cup feels like a team again. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971449/why-pakistans-squad-at-this-years-t20-world-cup-feels-like-a-team-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Coke Studio released ‘&lt;em&gt;Phir Se Game Uthadein&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; an anthem for the ODI World Cup set to happen the same year. It was inspired by Slogett and Carlone’s 1992 anthem ‘Who Rules the World’&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the soundtrack to Pakistan’s first and most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1720494&quot;&gt;fabled major victory in cricket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced by Strings and sung by Atif Aslam, the song proclaimed “&lt;em&gt;Jeet ki daastaan, phir ho gi jawaan”&lt;/em&gt; to the same tune as “&lt;em&gt;Who’s gonna be number one, who’s gonna take up the cup?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a dexterity required to mythologise something that has actually happened — Pakistan has done that with the 1992 World Cup. There must have been a time when the historical immediacy of the victory would lend itself as proof that it was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ever since I can remember, the 1992 World Cup has been a pedestalised peak that seems harder and harder to re-mount as the years go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1992 is invoked in every metaphor for victory in Pakistan, sporting or otherwise. It is the incantation we chant when we are inviting good fortune, and the prayer we use to give shape to this imagined fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look for it every time we’re stuck in a quagmire mid-tournament (which is by and large a yearly occurrence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015 invocation was no different. The words &lt;em&gt;josh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;junoon&lt;/em&gt; were used, as they always are, those abstract ideals of hope and zeal and valour that never fully lend themselves in translations to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what was perhaps most intriguing about this remake was the fact that a sad follow-up was shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pakistan was knocked out by Australia (because, of course), the TV and video advertisements that brandished all colours of waving flags a day before were replaced by clips of an imagined aftermath: hung faces in front of projector screens, the green stars and crescents painted on them going flaccid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empty rooftops with stray, limp pieces of confetti sadly billowing in the breeze. A sadder version of the song, essentially saying “we lost, but it’s okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the reprise that particularly tickled my fancy, but the idea that a company producing a hype song for one of the decade’s most anticipated cricketing events had the foresight to produce a version for the sadder, but probably likelier outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like it came as a shock — the campaign included the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1163765&quot;&gt;routine defeat&lt;/a&gt; to India, the fabled 1-4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1171788/world-cup-campaign-pakistan-merely-lived-up-to-its-billing#:~:text=A%20150%2Drun%20loss%20to%20an%20equally%20unpredictable%20West%20Indies%20side&quot;&gt;collapse &lt;/a&gt;against the West Indies that the country woke up before dawn to witness, and of course, an immediately historicised dropped catch in the quarter final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that Pakistan losing or ungracefully bowing out of a tournament isn’t necessarily an unfamiliar feeling. It is often anticipated, often met with a begrudging acknowledgement: “&lt;em&gt;haan yaar, pata tha yehi hoga.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I was thirteen years old during that particular World Cup, and while I do remember all the horrors in technicolour, I cannot help but remember the few gleaming specks of joy that somehow muscled their way out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a then 27-year-old Sarfaraz Ahmed playing perhaps the first iconic knock of his career against South Africa, falling short of a half-century by one run, and Pakistan winning a game that it probably shouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan player Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates in a match during the 2015 ICC World Cup. — Reuters/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the world, as Wahab Riaz was bowling ball after ball of the spell of his life to Shane Watson, I remember loitering around my school’s staffroom during the quarter final, asking the one teacher who would indulge my classmates and me by giving us an update on the score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each of these trips, we would trundle back to class and take a moment to collectively (mournfully) pray at our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember realising properly for the first time in my life that all the stretched out, worn out, drawn out cliches about coming back to this team over and over again would be true for my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket feels different now than it did back then — it’s faster and more saturated, with so many more places and people and things involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some form of a “World Cup” every year, and it feels difficult to truly feel what a looming World Cup feels like when one is around the corner every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more recently, the constant uncertainty around cricket has been cause for further disillusionment — a Champions Trophy which was supposed to happen entirely at home &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;not having been so&lt;/a&gt;, disappointing showings in 2023 and 2024, and an Asia Cup truncated with political puppet shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into the T20 World Cup, Pakistan is once again at the centre of what looks like a less-than-ideal unfolding: Pakistan has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycotted &lt;/a&gt;the match against India in solidarity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;against ICC’s inconsistent treatment across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/06202528298086f.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the hybrid-model compromise with India in 2024, which promised neutral venues for both teams in the case of an ICC tournament in either one, Pakistan will be playing its group matches in Colombo, with Sri Lanka being cohosts for the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have a long history with our good friend Colombo in the rain, and with a fluctuating percentage of rain in the forecast, the possibility of any of Pakistan’s games being washed out is not zero. There is no margin for error. The realistic thing would be to not hope too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, one can’t help but feel like that after a while; the Pakistan side showing up to this World Cup feels like a team again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Ali Agha’s success at number 3 has unlocked a vein of potential for Pakistan — while his T20 strike rate is around 122, at this position, he has averaged 37 and struck at a solid 168, especially in the recent series against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966516&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970108&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batting aside, Agha has amassed T20 series wins against South Africa, Australia, West Indies and Bangladesh, in addition to two tri-series wins and leading Pakistan to be the finalists in the Asia Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we speak, Saim Ayub is the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971031&quot;&gt;number one&lt;/a&gt; all-rounder in T20 cricket, and Usman Tariq, with his perfectly legal action, has provided Pakistan’s bowling line-up with a contested but undeniable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971011/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-world-cup-exit&quot;&gt;spin arsenal&lt;/a&gt; of Saim, Abrar Ahmed, Usman Tariq, Shadab Khan and Muhammad Nawaz has shaped up to be one of the most promising in the tournament, if the statement 3-0 win against Australia was any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All histories up till now have shown that Pakistan’s form before a tournament is just about as untrustworthy as Pakistan’s performances during one — but against all my wisdom, I am compelled to hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, cricket is currently at the mercy of administrative mishaps and Pakistan fans are at the mercy of the Pakistan cricket team. But sometimes it is good to remember that not even the most illustrious of wisdoms and an undeniable breadth of knowledge does not absolve us of this reality: when Pakistan plays cricket, we will be tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this time, the sadder songs will remain in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Captain Salman Agha defends ‘X factor’ Usman Tariq’s bowling action ahead of T20 World Cup opener. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971423/captain-salman-agha-defends-x-factor-usman-tariqs-bowling-action-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-opener</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Agha defended off-spinner Usman Tariq’s unorthodox bowling action on Friday and called him the side’s “X factor” on the eve of their Twenty20 World Cup opener against the Netherlands in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariq, who has played three T20 Internationals since his debut against South Africa in November, has been reported twice for a suspect bowling action in the Pakistan Super League. His bowling style culminates in him pausing near the crease before firing the ball in with a side-arm sling-shot action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old claimed two wickets in his second T20 International, against Australia, and Australia batsman Cameron Green — one of his two victims in that match in Lahore — made a chucking gesture after being dismissed as he made his way off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand why we are talking about his action because in my opinion it is a fair action,” Salman told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been tested twice and he has been cleared,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there is no problem in his action. Yes, he is the X factor of the team, and where we feel that we need an X factor, we will definitely use him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having decided to boycott their Group A contest against defending champions India after Bangladesh were excluded from the tournament, Pakistan will have little margin for error in their bid to qualify for the Super 8 stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from India, the group also contains the United States, who stunned Pakistan via the Super Over in the 2024 edition of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman said they would have to be at their best even against second-tier teams like Namibia or the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is very important because you haven’t played much against these sides and you don’t really know their strength and weaknesses,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So it is very, very important to bring your A game, and we as a team only think about how we can execute our plans for 40 overs.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crisis of neutrality at ICC. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971358/crisis-of-neutrality-at-icc</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;UNLESS you’ve been perpetually asleep since 1947, Pakistan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to play an upcoming T20 World Cup group match against India would come as no surprise. Cricket between India and Pakistan has often been seen as a proxy war, and it used to be that this ‘war’ was played out on the field, with the competition between bat and ball determining victory and defeat. That was then. In recent times, even the selection of venues and itineraries has been weaponised. This is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could make a convincing case that India started it, and Pakistan has finally had no option but to respond with tit for tat. India’s cricketers haven’t played in Pakistan since 2008, when the Asia Cup was held in Karachi. Over this period, Pakistan has nevertheless played at Indian venues no less than 19 times, the last in November 2023 as part of the ODI World Cup. Initially, India’s refusal could be justified as a matter of safety and security. After all, even Pakistan’s own team was forced to play in the UAE for several years after the Lahore terrorism of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet once Pakistan’s security situation improved and other top-tier teams such as Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand returned to play at Pakistani venues, India’s cricket board had to fetch another excuse. It came up with the notion of “government permission”, effectively ceding decision-making to the hardline BJP, India’s current ruling party. The mask was finally off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this Indian intransigence, Pakistan’s hosting of last year’s Champions Trophy was reduced to a farce. While the rest of the eight-team tournament proceeded happily in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi, India was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430&quot;&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; to play all five of its matches in Dubai, including a high-voltage group match versus Pakistan on Feb 23 as well as the tournament final on March 9. What explains this extreme asymmetry is India’s clout as a cricketing superpower. With its massive billion-plus audience, India has dominated world cricket through revenues, sponsorships, lobbying and, ultimately, commandeering of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the global body of cricket governance. The situation had become very frustrating for Pakistan to the point that it seemed we had no agency in the matter, no cards left to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent dramatic political developments, however, have reset this calculus. One was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrow&lt;/a&gt; of Indian-backed Sheikh Hasina Wajid in Bangladesh, which has ignited a storm of Bangladeshi fury towards its meddling western neighbour. The other was the backfiring adventurism of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988&quot;&gt;Operation Sindoor&lt;/a&gt;, which has infused Pakistani administrators with a newfound confidence in their posture towards India. The ripples of these two convulsions have now converged in the cricketing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First came Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967562&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to the ICC to have their upcoming World Cup matches shifted outside India to Sri Lanka, a concession that Pakistan had already extracted. Ostensibly triggered by the unexplained expulsion of a Bangladeshi player from an Indian Premier League franchise, Bangladesh’s reluctance to play in India actually reflects worsening political ties. Emboldened by Bangladesh, Pakistan too dug in its heels, announcing ongoing internal deliberations, with a final call on World Cup participation to be made by the Pakistani government on Feb 1. That decision was made public in a tweet: Pakistan would play the World Cup but boycott the group match versus India. The possibility of facing India at a later stage of the tournament was left unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal by the Pakistan Cricket Board, because you are throwing away two valuable points and jeopardising qualification to the next stage. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly. Pakistan has a terrible record against India in ICC tournaments, and it is highly likely we would have lost this match anyway. Fortunately, our other three opponents in the group stage are all associate-level teams which, although potentially a banana peel, is no mountain to climb either. Meanwhile, we have deprived the Indian public of its favourite spectacle — thrashing Pakistan at cricket. Simply put, these matches have become television gold for India. The India-Pakistan match in the 2023 ODI World Cup attracted a collective (terrestrial and digital) viewership of over 400 million, and the viewership of last year’s Champions Trophy India-Pakistan match exceeded 800m. The now-defunct encounter of Feb 15 would surely have garnered similar numbers. Should India and Pakistan clash later at the knockout stage, you can be assured all viewership records will be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selective boycott has triggered polite chatter in Pakistani circles while unleashing uproar in India. That tells you how effective it’s been. Indian hardliners are livid and the Indian public is crushed with disappointment. At the same time, some sensible Indian voices have also emerged. Shashi Tharoor, the erudite Indian politician and scholar, has urged India to reach out to Pakistan and Bangladesh under ICC’s umbrella and “call off this nonsense”. Sharda Ugra, a respected Indian cricket journalist, has laid the blame squarely on India’s cricket board, accusing it of petty egoism and institutional failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt; in this clutter, apart from cricket itself, is Bangladesh, who have every reason to feel hard done by. The could easily have played their matches in Sri Lanka, following Pakistan’s precedent; yet the ICC threatened them with replacement, and that threat was eventually carried out. This leaves the ICC with a lot to answer for. As an organisation tasked with the welfare of global cricket, it should be a neutral body; instead, it has been reduced to a mouthpiece for India. All cricketing nations need to join forces, take principled stands, and hold the ICC accountable. The costs of doing nothing are simply too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The writer, a professor of neurology at Aga Khan University, has written on cricket for international publications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India’s stranglehold on cricket questioned after Pakistan’s show of solidarity with BD. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971308/indias-stranglehold-on-cricket-questioned-after-pakistans-show-of-solidarity-with-bd</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;INDIA’S dominance over world cricket has been evident for nearly two decades, underpinned by its vast population and the commercial power of its domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Indian Premier League in 2008 only entrenched that advantage, enabling the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to amass unprecedented financial influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That influence has seldom been questioned, even when it appeared to undermine competitive balance. The elephant in the room — that international cricket increasingly operates on terms set by India — is no longer being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; its T20 World Cup group match against India has drawn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970619/principles-before-commercial-interests-cricketers-politicians-react-to-pakistan-boycotting-india-match-in-t20-world-cup&quot;&gt;rare public backing&lt;/a&gt; from senior voices in cricket commentary, who have questioned the International Cricket Council’s consistency and the growing influence of commercial and political considerations on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUSSAIN, ATHERTON FLAG INCONSISTENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking on the Sky Cricket Podcast alongside Michael Atherton, said Pakistan and Bangladesh were justified in pushing back against what he described as selective enforcement of ICC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At some stage someone has got to say enough is enough — can we just get back to playing cricket?” Hussain said, arguing that the central issue was consistency rather than politics. He questioned whether the ICC would have adopted a similarly rigid stance had India been unable to travel due to government directives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hussain praised Bangladesh for defending its position after being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;dropped from the tournament&lt;/a&gt; when the ICC declined to relocate its matches from India to Sri Lanka, and described Pakistan’s boycott of the India fixture as a necessary stand against a system increasingly shaped by financial and political power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atherton echoed those concerns, pointing to previous instances in which India was allowed to play at neutral venues after refusing to tour Pakistan. Denying Bangladesh similar flexibility, he warned, risked undermining the credibility of international cricket’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If allowances have been made before, you can’t suddenly decide not to make them now,” Atherton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former England batter Mark Butcher went further, calling Pakistan’s selective boycott a “masterstroke” that exposed the tournament’s financial fragility. By targeting only the India match — the most commercially valuable fixture in world cricket — Butcher said Pakistan had highlighted the extent to which broadcasters, the ICC and co-host India depended on a single contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole thing rests on that game,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHEHBAZ DEFENDS DECISION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was against this backdrop that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971047&quot;&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the decision, saying Pakistan would not play the match against India while continuing to participate in the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a federal cabinet meeting on Wednesday, he said Pakistan stood with Bangladesh and that while sport should remain free of politics, principles of fairness could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh, the move was welcomed. Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan thanked Pakistan for its support, calling it a principled stand against preferential treatment and double standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi also weighed in, urging the ICC to ensure equal treatment of all member boards and arguing that cricket should serve as a bridge when politics divides nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all former players, however, supported the boycott. Former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee said he hoped the match would still go ahead, calling for politics to be kept out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s get the politics out of it,” Lee said on the Mr Cricket UAE podcast. “I really hope the match happens. The whole world watches when India and Pakistan play one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision, however, does not come without risk. The ICC has warned of potential long-term consequences for Pakistan cricket, including sanctions, withheld revenue distributions and compensation claims from broadcasters. Some observers question whether the gesture, however principled, adequately accounts for the financial asymmetries that already favour India.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pemra remains ‘headless’ as new chief awaits  PM Office nod. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971340/pemra-remains-headless-as-new-chief-awaits-pm-office-nod</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Even though the country’s electronic media regulator has been without a chairperson since October, a summary for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964833&quot;&gt;appointment&lt;/a&gt; of Ambreen Jan as head of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) has been pending with the Prime Minister’s Office for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Jan, a former federal secretary for information, was selected by the parliamentary panel as Pemra chairperson. If her appointment is approved, she will be the first woman to head the authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a reliable source, Ambreen Jan’s confirmation has been held up due to “objections regarding security clearance”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Jan is a former Grade-22 officer and has served as information secretary, the director general of Radio Pakistan and as managing director of PTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also served as press counsellor in Bangladesh from 2011 to 2018, when Islamabad-Dhaka ties were under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was among the five shortlisted candidates considered for the Pemra job, along with retired Brigadier Anwar Ahmed, journalist Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf and Dr Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final shortlist narrowed the choice to three candidates, omitting the names of Irfan Ashraf and Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under an amendment made to&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pemra.gov.pk/assets/uploads/legal/Ordinance_2002.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Pemra Act,&lt;/a&gt; a parliamentary committee consisting of four members — two each from the National Assembly and the Senate — will recommend a candidate for appointment as head of the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury benches and the opposition will have one member each from the National Assembly and the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parliamentary committee finalised and recommended the candidate for appointment by the President over a month ago, but the file is awaiting onward transmission to the Presidency from the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saleem Baig, the previous Pemra chairman, was also an officer of the Information Group. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1410839&quot;&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and reappointed in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Baig retired in September last year after becoming the longest serving head of the Authority. His predecessor, Absar Alam, was removed from the post by the Lahore High Court in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulator’s mandate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pemra was established under the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw2-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2FrbZ8=-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj-con-9741&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pemra Ordinance 2002&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate and regulate the private electronic media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has mandate to improve the standards of information, education and entertainment and to facilitate dissemination of information related to current affairs, religious matters, art, culture as well as science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key segments regulated by Pemra include Direct to Home (DTH) broadcasting, satellite television, landing rights permission (LRP), FM Radio and Cable TV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UN human rights agency in ‘survival mode’: chief. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971244/un-human-rights-agency-in-survival-mode-chief</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations human rights chief said on Thursday that his agency was “in survival mode” due to funding shortfalls, as he launched a $400 million appeal to tackle global rights crises in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volker Turk warned countries that at a time when global human rights are under significant assault, his office was facing dire funding shortages hampering its increasingly important and life-saving work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our reporting provides credible information on atrocities and human rights trends at a time when truth is being eroded by disinformation and censorship,” he told diplomats at the UN rights office headquarters in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a lifeline for the abused, a megaphone for the silenced, and a steadfast ally to those who risk everything to defend the rights of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the UN Human Rights Office’s regular budget — set by the UN General Assembly of member states — was $246m, but it ultimately received only $191.5m of that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also sought $500m in voluntary contributions, of which $257.8m came in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the UN’s human rights work has long been chronically underfunded, but Turk said, “We are currently in survival mode, delivering under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These cuts and reductions untie perpetrators’ hands everywhere, leaving them to do whatever they please. With crises mounting, we cannot afford a human rights system in crisis,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN human rights office lost around 300 out of 2,000 staff last year and had to end or scale back its work in 17 countries. Its programme in Myanmar, for example, was cut by 60 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#high-impact-low-cost&quot; id=&quot;high-impact-low-cost&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;High impact, low cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the UN General Assembly approved a regular budget of $224.3m for human rights. However, with the United Nations facing a liquidity crisis, uncertainty remains over how much Turk’s office will receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is among a slew of international organisations hit by a global funding crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States was the UN’ biggest contributor but has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1895673&quot;&gt;slashed &lt;/a&gt;its funding since President Donald Trump returned to power in January 2025 — while other countries have tightened their belts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN chief Antonio Guterres &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970287&quot;&gt;warned &lt;/a&gt;last Friday that the world body is on the brink of financial collapse and could run out of cash by July, as he urged countries to pay their dues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Turk is seeking $400m in voluntary funding from countries and donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said human rights accounted for a very small slice of overall UN spending but produced “high-impact” results that help to stabilise communities, build trust in institutions and underpin lasting peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The cost of our work is low; the human cost of underinvestment is immeasurable,” he insisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, UN human rights staff working in 87 countries undertook more than 5,000 human rights monitoring missions — down from 11,000 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That means less evidence for both protection and prevention,” said Turk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#countering-secrecy&quot; id=&quot;countering-secrecy&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Countering secrecy’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving examples of his office’s work, Turk said it supported 67,000 survivors of torture and modern slavery, documented tens of thousands of human rights violations and exposed discrimination in more than 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its monitoring mission in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970922&quot;&gt;Ukraine &lt;/a&gt;is the “only organisation” with a comprehensive record of verified civilian casualties “since the initial Russian invasion in 2014”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1854057&quot;&gt;fact-finding mission&lt;/a&gt; on the 2024 crackdown “helped establish a comprehensive record of systematic and serious human rights abuses”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the probe in the Democratic Republic of Congo “uncovered patterns of grave human rights violations that may amount to crimes against humanity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All this work aims to bring the stories of victims to the world, countering secrecy — the oppressor’s strongest ally — and challenging injustice and impunity,” Turk said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan team will seek govt nod if it meets India in T20 World Cup knockout phase: captain Salman Agha. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240/pakistan-team-will-seek-govt-nod-if-it-meets-india-in-t20-world-cup-knockout-phase-captain-salman-agha</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will seek advice from their government if they reach the knockout phase of the T20 World Cup and meet arch-rivals India, captain Salman Agha said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament has been marred by an acrimonious political buildup after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;kicked out&lt;/a&gt; and Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to face co-hosts India in their Group A match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a semi-final or final showdown between the uneasy South Asian neighbours is still a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The India game is not in our control. It was the government’s decision and if we have to play them in the semi-final or the final, we will go back to them and act on their advice,” Agha told reporters in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India, citing security concerns, as relations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt; and were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;kicked out&lt;/a&gt; of Group C by the International Cricket Council (ICC), to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan backed Bangladesh’s plea to have their games moved to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government in Islamabad cleared the national team to take part but ordered them not to play in the marquee group match against India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s sad Bangladesh are not here. They have a very good side. Hopefully, they will support us,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in multinational events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will face Namibia, the Netherlands and the United States in the group stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited to play in this tournament. We lost to USA in the last World Cup and we are determined to put that disappointment behind us and put a few things right,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will not only lose two points for forfeiting their India match but will also take a big hit to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even losing one of their group games to bad weather could make it difficult for Pakistan to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know the margin for error is small, but we can’t control the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are here to play good cricket and we’re not bothered about the conditions,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, the 2009 champions, arrive after a 3-0 whitewash of Australia at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been playing really good cricket. We haven’t lost a series since the Asia Cup last year. Everything is coming along nicely and we’re confident of doing well,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Pakistan’s games will be played in Sri Lanka, where they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966516&quot;&gt;toured in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very happy to play in Sri Lanka — it’s a second home for me. This is my sixth visit, we know the conditions and we get a lot of support,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lahore Qalandars directly sign Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rehman for over Rs60m. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971235/lahore-qalandars-directly-sign-bangladesh-pacer-mustafizur-rehman-for-over-rs60m</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Lahore Qalandars announced on Thursday that it had directly signed Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman for PSL’s 11th edition, spending over Rs60 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our Bangladeshi brother, Mustafizur, picked in 2016 and 2018, is now our direct signing and finally back with the family. Once a Qalandar, always a Qalandar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amount spent on DS: PKR6.44 crore,” the announcement on Lahore Qalandar’s X account said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lahoreqalandars/status/2019313875754332331&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965494&quot;&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; for the PSL draft in early January, following his release from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by KKR for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision came amid strained relations between India and Bangla­desh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Bangladesh banned IPL broadcasts in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board requested the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC, however, rejected the requested, replacing Bangladesh with Scotland in the 20-team tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously also featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nipah virus no immediate threat to citizens: AKUH experts. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971067/nipah-virus-no-immediate-threat-to-citizens-akuh-experts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: While rejecting fears concerning the possible&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969658&quot;&gt; spread&lt;/a&gt; of Nipah virus in Pakistan, experts at a roundtable conference held on Wednesday underscored the need for building healthcare readiness and prioritising implementation of infection control protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were speaking at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) at a briefing organised to create awareness about epidemiological risks, transmission pathways and prevention strategies related to Nipah virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, the zoonotic virus, which is an infectious agent that jumps from animals to humans, causing disease, currently poses no direct threat to Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of late January, 2026, only two cases involving healthcare workers have been&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt; confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in West Bengal, India, and that the risk of international spread is currently categorised as low due to the geographical distance of the outbreak (eastern India, Bangladesh) and the virus’ limited human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress need to improve healthcare standards and adopt basic hygiene protocols&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is found in animals but can also affect humans. However, only a handful of cases (of human-to-human transmission) have been reported in recent years globally,” said Dr Faisal Mahmood, Professor, infectious diseases and Associate Chief Medical Officer, AKUH, adding that no case has been reported in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experts explained that the primary mode of Nipah virus transmission is zoonotic, occurring through direct contact with infected bats or the consumption of food, such as raw tree sap or fruit, contaminated by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is not spread through casual exposure to bats, such as flying nearby. It has a high fatality rate of 40 to 50 per cent but it doesn’t spread as easily as respiratory viruses such as Covid-19,” Dr Mahmood clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Nosheen Nasir, Associate Professor and Section Head of Infectious Diseases Department, AKUH, the two cases confirmed in West Bengal, India, were of nurses working at the same hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of them is recovering while another is reported to be on ventilator support. The authorities there have tested 190 contacts, all of them have tested negative,” she said, adding that no case had been reported from the western region of India that bordered Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to her, cases of Nipah virus infection were first reported in 1998 in Malaysia, where it affected pig farmers. Since then, cases have reported in Bangladesh, India, the Philippines and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About its clinical manifestation, she said the infection initially presented with flu like symptoms but rapidly progressed to severe brain inflammation, causing neurological problems including fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question about the Nipah cases affecting healthcare workers, the experts agreed that infection control practices were too weak in Pakistan and needed to be implemented strictly that would help address growing threat of all kinds of infectious diseases including HIV and hepatitis C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t need extra wards. We just need to be vigilant, improve our healthcare standards and adopt basic hygiene protocols,” Dr Mahmood said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to concerns over the strong regional presence of the virus and Pakistan’s compromised healthcare services, Dr Nosheen said: “The way the infection presents itself in humans, you can’t hide those cases. Having said that, we need to improve clinical surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel acknowledged the government’s proactive screening of travellers at international entry points as a positive step in safeguarding public health. Drawing on lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic nearly six years ago, AKUH experts emphasised that strong health resilience is built through early preparedness, effective coordination, and sustained community awareness, rather than reactive containment alone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JPMorgan plans frontier bond index. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970953/jpmorgan-plans-frontier-bond-index</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Pakistan among top-weighted countries in planned benchmark&lt;br /&gt;• Proposed gauge targets high-yield local bonds in 20-25 economies across Asia, Africa and beyond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON: JPMorgan is finalising plans for a new index to track frontier market local currency bonds, investors consulted on the details told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, as the bank looks to satisfy a growing appetite for riskier and more diversified high-yield debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move, which comes 15 years after the Wall Street bank launched its hard-currency Next Generation Markets Index (NEXGEM) frontier index, coincides with the year-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968175&quot;&gt;slump&lt;/a&gt; in the dollar and some extraordinary recent rallies in markets like Argentina, Ecuador and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment on the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six leading money managers who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; on condition of anonymity said the bank’s engagements with them reached an advanced stage in the second half of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed index includes 20 to 25 countries, with Egypt, Vietnam, Kenya, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh having the largest “weightings”, three of the managers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bond sizes and caps on weighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one source, there would be a limit that means no country has a weighting of more than 8 per cent. A second source said an earlier consultation document had a proposed 10pc limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also set to only include bonds of at least $250 million equivalent, although that has raised issues around Zambia, which many would like to see included but has traditionally only sold smaller individual bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We expect they (JPMorgan) will give us a formal structure for the index around June with the opportunity to make some final comments,” said one senior fund manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are then likely to formally launch the index next year, we think.” Another senior fund manager said the initial announcement might be as early as the end of March, which could also bring the formal launch date forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trillion dollar market FTSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell has already had an equivalent index since 2021. JPMorgan’s versions, however, are more prominent among emerging market money managers, who effectively use them to compile their funds and measure their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis by Neuberger Berman estimates tradable local-currency debt has trebled over the last decade to around $1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also calculates that over the last eight years, frontier market local FX debt had outperformed JPMorgan’s mainstream emerging market local currency index by almost 2.5 percentage points, and also outstripped the EM dollar bond index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We see that as a confirmation that frontier market growth and general economic performance has been systematically underpriced,” Neuberger Berman’s Rob Drijkoningen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Bank, frontier economies are home to a fifth of the world’s population but account for just 3.1pc of global capital flows and less than 5pc of global GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their populations, however, are expected to increase by another 800 million over the next 25 years more than the rest of the world combined — meaning they will play an increasingly important role in global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect JPMorgan’s new debt index to help expand local currency bond markets — something long-championed by the World Bank and IMF as a way to reduce the number of debt crises caused when currency crashes leave governments unable to pay hard-currency debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zambia and eligibility requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising interest in frontier market debt also comes as shaken confidence in once-safe debt in the developed world pushes capital flows to other parts of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the investors raised questions about Zambia, which until recently had only sold sub-$250 million local-currency bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not in some of JPMorgan’s early outlines, the investors said, but the country has since issued at least one larger bond, raising hopes it will now make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One eligibility requirement that mirrors JPMorgan’s GBI-EM index of major emerging economies is that included bonds will have more than 2.5 years of remaining maturity — the time before full repayment is due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan estimated in September the index will have approximately 400 basis points or more of “pick-up” in yield over the GBI-EM, with over 60pc of the index constituents yielding more than 10pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential promotion of top-weighted countries like Egypt and Nigeria to the GBI-EM index in coming years is another issue that could alter the index’s makeup, possibly putting off some investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will be important to nail that down,” one senior fund manager said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aid, Ports, And The Limits of Incrementalism: What India’s Budget Says About Its Foreign Policy. [ southasiamonitor ]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet the strategic costs are real. Reduced engagement in Bangladesh risks ceding influence at a moment when Dhaka is actively diversifying its partnerships. Hesitation over Chabahar weakens India’s leverage in Iran and Central Asia and underscores its vulnerability to US pressure even as it seeks a more multipolar foreign policy. The 2026–27 Budget does not signal a dramatic shift in Indian foreign policy. There is no abandonment of neighbours-first rhetoric or of connectivity-led diplomacy. What it reveals instead is a narrowing circle of feasible economic action.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ideals of 1971 represent inclusivity, human dignity, and resistance to oppression. Baul and Sufi traditions reject radical views and promote humanism and coexistence. Islam in Bengal arrived largely through Sufis—from Persia, Arabia, and Central Asia—who emphasized spirituality, tolerance, and accommodation. These traditions resonated with local Hindu practices and gave rise to syncretic forms such as Baul philosophy. Rabindranath Tagore and Nazrul Islam embodied this civilizational synthesis.     &lt;br /&gt;

      <description>An earthquake measuring 4.1 magnitude shook Bangladesh on Tuesday. The tremor occurred at a depth of 150 kilometers. Bangladesh is situated in a seismically active region where three major tectonic plates converge. This geological setting makes the country highly prone to earthquakes.</description>

      <title>COMMENT: Why Pakistan must become a cricket superpower. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970748/comment-why-pakistan-must-become-a-cricket-superpower</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PAKISTAN’S &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; of its T20 World Cup match against India raises two fundamental questions: why the PCB took this decision, and what it hopes to achieve by it. The fact that neither answer is particularly clear invites a deeper concern, whether this dramatic gesture was fully thought through at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, let’s be clear on a few points. The ICC is controlled by India. It is a governing body that behaves like a wholly owned subsidiary of the BCCI. The ICC does not run international cricket, the BCCI — and therefore the Indian government — does. This is realpolitik. The rule of “might is right”. India is in charge, both as policymaker and paymaster, however you describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s malign dictatorship of international cricket is to be condemned, just as the previous dominance of England and Australia had been condemned. Today, India is the Pied Piper of cricket, playing a seductive tune that brings the rats of the world’s cricket boards under its control. Something does need to be done, namely ICC’s power and independence must be restored. But is this what Pakistan’s unilateral boycott will achieve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has a political dispute with Pakistan, which it chooses to operationalise by “boycotting” bilateral series with Pakistan and refusing to set foot in the country. No other nation would be allowed to behave in this despotic manner. We’ve just seen what has happened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;. Despotic rule is hypocritical. It is self-serving, and it is brutish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole where its money and friends should be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next tier of cricket nations, when it comes to financial might, England and Australia, are reliant on India for their revenues. They have sold their integrity and independence for Indian rupees. The remaining countries are too weak and irrelevant when it comes to tackling the excesses of India’s cricketing hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies to the corporations and the broadcasters who invest in cricket. Without India’s billion-plus population, they don’t have a big enough market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of cricket commerce, India’s gravitational pull is too great. Fans might care about some of these hypocrisies and inequalities, but the global audience doesn’t care enough about whether Bangladesh is expelled or Pakistan boycotts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, value in a Pakistan-India contest in a major tournament, otherwise why else would it be a manufactured feature of every single major competition. The match is a money spinner; it is good for India’s coffers. And given the fact that Pakistan seems unable to compete on these occasions, it is a perfect morale booster for the Indian nation, with profit built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Pakistan’s boycott of the India match will hurt India a little. India will feel the pinch in its pocket, and so too will the other ICC members. But that pinch will only be a pinch. India will pocket the points instead and move closer to the next round of the tournament. Pakistan will lose valuable revenue and the points. Would Bangladesh have done the same for Pakistan? It hasn’t in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, considering the long history of India’s unfair sidelining of Pakistan, we know other nations have not and would not do the same for Pakistan. Pakistan is now a middle nation, at best, in the world of international cricket. It does not have financial muscle and it is not good enough on the field to pull other nations to its side. India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole in its pocket where its money and its friends should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the language of Donald Trump, Pakistan has no cards. All this leaves Pakistan in a mess. It cannot genuinely hope to achieve anything meaningful as a result of its boycott. The deck is stacked against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principle, then, is all that Pakistan has left. But what is the principle here? If the principle is taking a stand in support of Bangladesh, then it is an empty gesture, admittedly a noisy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the principle is to protest India’s long history of mistreatment of Pakistan, the mistreatment will continue. If the principle is to protest India’s unconstitutional rule of international cricket, the cause is just but the means of protest amateurish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Pakistan really wants here is a shift in the balance of power in international cricket. It is entirely fair to think that must happen by freeing international cricket from India’s grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to achieve this, Pakistan requires a long-term strategy with two primary objectives: to become commercially and politically powerful in international cricket, and to become a force again on the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might feel good to shout about a boycott, to savour a perceived blow to India’s giant ego, but this is no more than a captive shouting into a straitjacket, or an opiate for the masses. If Pakistan is serious about a reset in cricket’s international order, it must begin by working out how it can become a cricketing superpower again, a superpower that is financially strong and independent of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do that and others might follow. Sadly, for the current leaders of Pakistan and its cricket, doing just that seems to be too much like hard thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

But in the comfort of the crowded food courts of Kolkata shopping malls, over black coffee and Indian fast food, the exiled politicians of the Awami League sit plotting their political comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 16 months ago,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/bangladesh-student-protests-mass-movement-against-dictator&quot;&gt; a revolution against Bangladesh’s autocratic prime minister&lt;/a&gt; Sheikh Hasina forced her to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/05/bangladesh-pm-has-resigned-and-left-country-media-reports-say-sheikh-hasina&quot;&gt;dramatically flee the country&lt;/a&gt;, jumping on a helicopter to India as an enraged onslaught of protesters marched towards her residence.

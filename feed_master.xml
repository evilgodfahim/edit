      <description>Bangladesh is one of the 10 most climate vulnerable nations in the world. And the prime mover of the climate vulnerability is human action.

      <title>Absorbing population growth. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974737/absorbing-population-growth</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;FINALLY, the debate about whether rapid population growth is beneficial or pernicious for the economy appears to be settled. While the evidence was extensive and categorical, it has taken several decades for the numbers to be absorbed by our leading economists. In the meantime, we have potentially lost billions of dollars in GDP, experienced the tragedy of several thousand maternal and child deaths, and seen a decline in per capita income as the cost of not pursuing sound population policies and actions to bring down our rapid population growth rate. While all our neighbours, most prominently Bangladesh, took clear and purposeful steps, we have complacently accepted high and even rising population growth rates since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus created at DawnMedia’s &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUNr-LEZxTWbD3UcLWdAvL5EHJZFrRWFCTRsF-4UGt4/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paki­stan Population Summit&lt;/a&gt; last December confirmed several truths. First and foremost is that economic growth and prosperity for Pakistan are impossible under current demographic trends. High fertility and population growth rates are eating into an already low economic growth, resulting in greater poverty and income inequalities. There is categorical evidence that larger households with more dependents save less, spend less on education and eat lower-quality food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the expectation of a demographic dividend due to the surge in the working population is an elusive dream. In fact, this dream has been shattered by growing unemployment figures and a rising gap in the ability to generate employment to keep up with the millions of youth entering the labour force each year. The finance minister has publicly admitted that it is next to impossible, as not enough jobs are being generated to keep pace with the forecasted surge in the working-age population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it was proclaimed that urbanisation would be the engine of growth and generate employment. However, it has been pointed out by &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org/topics_population-policy/21/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pakistan@2050&lt;/a&gt; that structural changes are required to produce more jobs. Rapid urbanisation is being led by a push out of agriculture in rural areas to escape poverty, and not as a pull factor in search of better jobs. In fact, additional jobs in new sectors only provide minimal employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit brought together a wide spectrum of participants and speakers, generating some optimism that we have turned the corner on population issues. Foremost, a media house took the initiative of organising a summit on population. Another prominent media house has just launched the Waqfa campaign to raise awareness and change behaviour. Much of this positivity is the outcome of the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nam-Fw4f8AxJWOwIVBdqGPfl0GafIDG7/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Council of Islamic Ideology&lt;/a&gt; and Population Council consultation on the concept of tawazun (balance) and birth spacing last year. This declaration has been endorsed by 37 prominent ulema supporting family planning and birth spacing for improved outcomes for mothers, children and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations of a demographic dividend due to the surge in working numbers are misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hopeful sign is the unusual cross-party support for the national issue of tackling high population growth rates. The Parliamentary Forum for Population has had successful meetings over five years, discussing resource-sharing around population. Forum members passed a unanimous &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmdk7nFLzPSUU6Dk-gVa0oFkjrBu3926/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; in parliament last August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a consensus has emerged, why is there very little action at the national or provincial level that reflects a commitment to lowering population growth on an urgent and priority basis? This is not to undermine efforts and statements issued periodically by the provincial and federal leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to act is immediate. There is no time for piecemeal efforts or waiting for the provinces to reach the same level of capacity and concern regarding this daunting challenge. The federal government should take the first step and become the dominant partner. It must demonstrate intent, moving beyond statements: theirs should be a policy setting and coordination role with the provinces and regions. Larger provinces, such as Punjab and Sindh, can generate their initiatives, but less-resourced provinces and regions definitely require supplemental funds from the centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finance minister has been most consistent and prominent in publicly expressing that population growth is not just an impediment but an existential crisis for Pakistan. Creating the financing and resources to balance population concerns, especially in the most challenging, poorest, remotest and vulnerable parts of the country, must be his ministry’s priority. Direct financing for districts that are most vulnerable and lack the basics, preventing millions of households from accessing education, health and family planning, has to become as much of a priority as other financing reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Benazir Income Support Programme is renowned as one of the largest social protection programmes in the world. It is centred on women. Unwanted pregnancies affect the poorest women most directly, as do unwanted and mistimed births, which are not within their control. A cash transfer programme must be launched that enables poorer households to access family planning services. This programme would follow the same rationale as providing income support to women living in the poorest households through BISP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poorest women, when able to fulfil their unmet needs, will provide for improved health outcomes for families and create an economically powerful impetus for improving household welfare. It will present a programme that enables millions to benefit from improving other outcomes — such as their own health, household savings and children’s investments — and trigger a new turnaround dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the federal government must activate and announce the CCI mandated population fund. This population fund should be well-resourced and function under the finance ministry; it would be used to award grants to provinces and regions for additional family planning services. Grants can be directly linked with performance in improving health and related outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a growing consensus that population concerns will not be solved without improving educational outcomes, particularly for women and girls. The most powerful way of empowering women is through education and skills, but especially through paid work, by ensuring their safety, mobility and employability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is heartening that the public conversation has shifted towards putting women in the driving seat. It is high time that women’s empowerment is seen as a solution to unlocking greater economic growth by tapping into work and earnings potential and reaping the benefits of increased household savings and positive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The writer is Country Director, Population Council.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Pakistan is busting the Great Power monopoly on air power. [ responsiblestatecraft ]</title>
      <link>https://responsiblestatecraft.org/pakistan-air-force-fighter-jets/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media-library/jf-17-thunder-jet-fighter-pakistan.jpg?id=64965159&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=600&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C117%2C0%2C118&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a familiar refrain heard through the packed halls of the Munich Security Conference this year — soliloquies on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/10/europe/trump-munich-security-conference-report-intl-hnk&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;decades-long prosperous international order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” now under unprecedented strain. The gathering, as ever, was an echo chamber of transatlantic anxiety, tinged with denial about the steady unraveling of Western primacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of miles away, however, a more consequential transformation is unfolding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the&lt;a href=&quot;https://nastp.gov.pk/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Aerospace Science and Technology Park&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(NASTP) in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, visitors moved through halls lined with scaled-down models of fighter jets and combat drones, pausing at flight simulators where students honed their skills, and observed engineers guiding startups through prototype development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than an industrial showcase, NASTP captured a structural shift reshaping global security, as airpower is steadily democratized and credible aerial capability passes from the monopoly of wealthy Western states into the hands of emerging powers in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the modern era, scenes like this would have been unthinkable outside a narrow circle of elite powers. Advanced airpower demanded massive defense budgets, well-developed technological ecosystems, and political alignment with Western security networks that controlled access to cutting-edge aircraft, avionics and precision weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air superiority became the strategic privilege of close U.S. allies, the Soviet Union/Russia, and the handful of wealthy states able to sustain the financial and diplomatic costs of maintaining modern fleets. Export controls, sanctions regimes and political conditionalities ensured that control of the skies remained tightly guarded. Today, however, that long-standing monopoly is steadily eroding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this monopoly was U.S. control of the F-16, one of the most coveted fighter aircraft of the Cold War. Produced by General Dynamics, the multirole jet combined air-to-air combat capability with precision strike, a versatility it demonstrated in 1981 when Israeli F-16s destroyed &lt;a href=&quot;https://shafaq.com/en/Report/Israel-s-raid-on-Osirak-as-a-brave-new-world-JP-reported&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the F-16 became the geopolitical reward for serving as Washington’s frontline ally in expelling the Soviets from Afghanistan after 1980, while its rival India remained largely dependent on Soviet aircraft during the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and increasing tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan after 2001, led to a strategic regional realignment in South Asian arms procurement, and the erosion of Western dominance over advanced airpower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift became impossible to ignore when Washington moved in 2020 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2020/08/12/congress-has-secretly-blocked-us-arms-sales-to-turkey-for-nearly-two-years/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;block fellow NATO-member Turkey from acquiring advanced F-16 upgrades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following Ankara’s purchase of Russia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/turkeys-missile-dilemma-choice-between-russia-and-us&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;advanced S-400 missile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; air defense system. The decision exposed how even close allies remain vulnerable to Western export controls. Ankara responded by accelerating its indigenous drone program, producing low-cost, combat-proven platforms that would soon reshape battlefields from Ukraine and the Caucasus to the Middle East and Africa, a transformation catalyzed and accelerated by the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Pakistan and China advanced the JF-17. The name of the affordable jet took a swipe at its Western competitors, with “JF” standing for “Joint Fighter” and the number 17 suggesting an upgrade over the F-16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's willingness to transfer technology and co-produce advanced systems enabled Pakistan to field a modern multirole fighter capable of shooting down aircraft with beyond-visual-range missiles, delivering precision-guided munitions against ground targets and tracking multiple threats through its active electronically scanned array radar. Together, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/turkey-plans-drone-facility-in-pakistan-in-global-defense-push?embedded-checkout=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turkish combat drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the JF-17 have shattered the exclusivity of airpower, dismantling the financial and political barriers that long restricted credible aerial capability to a narrow circle of privileged states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, this transformation has been both strategic and reputational. Co-developed with China and increasingly produced domestically, the JF-17 anchors Islamabad’s shift from arms importer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2026/02/pakistans-burgeoning-arms-industry-strategic-opportunity-us/411168/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;aerospace power broker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That evolution gained global visibility during the four-day conflict last May, when Pakistani aircraft allegedly downed the Indian Rafale aircraft purchased from the French firm Dassault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That success generated international attention and drew rare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972507&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;public praise from U.S. President Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sharply boosting interest in the aircraft. Since then, the JF-17’s export footprint has expanded across Nigeria, Myanmar, Azerbaijan, and Iraq, with interest growing across Africa, the Middle East, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/9/why-is-pakistan-selling-its-jf-17-fighter-jets-to-bangladesh-and-others&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By offering a capable, affordable alternative to Western and Russian fighters, Pakistan is reshaping procurement choices for mid-tier states. In doing so, it is no longer merely buying security but it is increasingly enabling it, positioning itself as a strategic node in a rapidly diversifying global defense ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this shift extend beyond arms markets, as smaller and mid-tier states acquire credible airpower for the first time and regional hierarchies flatten and deterrence relationships recalibrate. In volatile regions from South Asia to the Middle East and the Caucasus, this diffusion of airpower is fundamentally altering how influence, coercion, and stability are negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For mid-tier powers, the war in Ukraine showed that without effective airpower, maneuver alone cannot deliver decisive battlefield outcomes. Instead, it drives conflicts toward attritional stalemate and forces a reassessment of force structure and operational concepts,” observes Lt Col Steen Kjaergaard from the Royal Danish Defence College, Denmark, who has closely followed the war in Ukraine to study the battlefields of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at NASTP in Rawalpindi, the objective is not merely to manufacture aircraft, but to cultivate human capital and technological depth underpinning long-term strategic autonomy. By embedding aerospace development within an entrepreneurial framework, Pakistan is laying the groundwork for enduring defense sovereignty, ensuring that its growing airpower is supported by indigenous skills, research capacity and industrial resilience rather than perpetual external dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Air Marshal (Ret.) Aamir Masood, who served in the Pakistan Air Force for over 40 years, “Aerospace [is likely to] remain as a weapon of choice for future leadership.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that the future “is all about non-contact warfare with beyond visual range precise ammunition, swarming drones and combat unmanned vehicles assisted by Artificial Intelligence based algorithms Decision support tools (DSTs). A country with better integration and networking would be able to have a faster OODA (Observe- Orientate- Decide- Act).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative effect is a reshaping of the global balance of military power. Western dominance of defense markets is weakening as a new cohort of arms exporters led by Turkey, Pakistan and China is redefining access to advanced aerial capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not only about cheaper alternatives. These states offer new solutions for markets confined by the political conditionality, or export mechanisms imposed by the Western world. This change is especially appealing in the Global South, eroding the domination of Western suppliers over elevated military capabilities,” said Flavius Caba-Maria, President of the Middle East Political and Economic Institute in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more states acquire affordable fighters and combat drones, deterrence relationships are shifting and regional competitions are intensifying, injecting both stability and volatility into fragile security environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The democratization of airpower does not automatically produce peace. Instead, it redistributes leverage, accelerates arms races and complicates strategic calculations. It also signals the arrival of a genuinely multipolar military order, in which technological capability is no longer the exclusive domain of a few privileged states. This transformation is unfolding in real time, redrawing the geopolitical map of the skies and, with it, the nature of air power itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee meets in Peshawar for Ramazan moon sighting. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974092/central-ruet-i-hilal-committee-meets-in-peshawar-for-ramazan-moon-sighting</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee is currently underway in Peshawar to sight the Ramazan moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee chairman, Maulana Syed Muhammad Abdul Khabir Azad, is presiding over the meeting at the Auqaf Department building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zonal and district Ruet-i-Hilal Committees in Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore and other cities have also gathered to sight the new moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, according to the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/ramadan-begins-tomorrow-moon-sighted-4109261&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the crescent moon was sighted in Bangladesh, meaning that the first day of the holy month would be observed on Thursday (February 19).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, based on the moon’s expected age, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972917&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that the first day of Ramazan was “likely to fall” on February 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Suparco said the final announcement regarding the beginning of the holy month would be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, “which is the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Afghanistan observed their first day of fasting on Wednesday after the crescent moon was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973918/ramazan-moon-sighted-in-saudi-arabia-uae&quot;&gt;sighted&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced a Rs38 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973178&quot;&gt;Ramazan Relief Package&lt;/a&gt; for 12.1 million deserving families across the four provinces as well as Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every deserving family will receive Rs13,000 through a digital wallet or bank transfer, without discrimination based on party affiliation or point of view,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nearly 100 states, 3 blocs slam West Bank ‘annexation’. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974013/nearly-100-states-3-blocs-slam-west-bank-annexation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Nations from Algeria to Zimbabwe, Arab League, OIC and EU take issue with unilateral decisions aimed at expanding unlawful Israeli presence&lt;br /&gt;• Israeli NGO warns against expansion of settlements ‘into Jerusalem’&lt;br /&gt;• Imam of Al Aqsa barred from entering mosque compound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM: As Israeli authorities barred the imam of Al Aqsa Mosque from entering the compound, 93 states — including the eight-nation Muslim bloc — slammed Tel Aviv’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973604&quot;&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; to designate lands in the occupied West Bank as so-called “state land”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Israeli cabinet approved measures that would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli NGOs have also raised alarm over the government’s settlement plan, which they say would mark the first expansion of Jerusalem’s borders into the occupied West Bank since 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement, issued by the Palestinian mission to the United Nations, 85 nations as well as the European Union (EU), Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Arab League called for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States who signed up to the latest statement include Algeria, Andorra, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, North Korea, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Liberia, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, South Korea, Russia, San Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, The Gambia, Turkiye, Uganda, UAE, Tanzania, UK, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen and Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier statement from the foreign ministers of the eight-nation Muslim bloc also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973896&quot;&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; Israel for approving procedures for the registration and settlement of land ownership across extensive areas of the occupied West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This illegal step constitutes a grave escalation aimed at accelerating illegal settlement activity, land confiscation, entrenching Israeli control, and applying unlawful Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” said the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This step reflects an attempt to impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land, thereby undermining the two-state solution, eroding the prospects for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State, and jeopardising the attainment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning by NGOs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned development, announced by Israel’s Ministry of Construction and Housing, is formally a westward expansion of the Geva Binyamin, or Adam, settlement situated north-east of Jerusalem in the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the area to be developed lies on the Israeli side of the separation barrier built in the early 2000s, while Geva Binyamin sits on the West Bank side of the barrier, and the two are separated by a road. In a statement, Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now said there would be no “territorial or functional connection” between the area to be developed and the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The new neighbourhood will be integral to the city of Jerusalem,” said Lior Amihai, Peace Now’s executive director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is unique about that one is that it will be connected directly to Jerusalem, but it will be beyond the annexed municipal border. So it will be in complete West Bank territory, but just adjacent to Jerusalem,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imam barred from Al Aqsa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Muhammad Al-Abbasi, a senior imam of the Al Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem, said on Tuesday that Israeli authorities had barred him from entering the compound, just days before the start of the holy month of Ramazan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have been barred from the mosque for a week, and the order can be renewed,” he said, adding that he was not informed of the reason for the ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Israeli police said they had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims follow the lunar calendar, which consists of 12 months lasting between 29 and 30 days. The start of the fasting month of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/2024-ramadan-when-starts-why-muslims-fast&quot;&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;depends on the sighting of the crescent moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi authorities said on Tuesday evening that the moon had been spotted by their teams, and therefore the fasting month would begin on Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uae&quot;&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/qatar&quot;&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/bahrain&quot;&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/kuwait&quot;&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/yemen&quot;&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine&quot;&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; announced that they would commence on Wednesday too. Sunni religious authorities in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iraq&quot;&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/lebanon&quot;&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;also said Ramadan was beginning that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A string of other Muslim-majority countries said they would begin on Thursday, having not sighted the moon, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, Brunei, Malaysia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/jordan&quot;&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/oman&quot;&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The office of Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the most senior Shia authority in Iraq, said Ramadan will start on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/india&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/pakistan&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; will make announcements on Wednesday as to whether Ramadan will begin on Thursday or Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spotting the crescent moon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Saudi Arabia - home to Islam’s holiest sites - has reported some of its sightings of the crescent moon on days when scientists and astronomers insisted it would be impossible to see it. Saudi authorities have not addressed these criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia uses a calendar called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ummulqura.org.sa/yearcalender.aspx?y=1446&amp;amp;l=True&quot;&gt;Umm al-Qura&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on calculations and marks key dates years in advance. For this year’s Ramadan, the calendar had marked it as starting on Wednesday 18 February.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month in the UAE, the Sharjah Academy for Astronomy, Space Sciences and Technology (SAASST) at the University of Sharjah &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/sharjah-astronomy-experts-calculation-ramadan-crescent-sighting-2026&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be scientifically impossible to sight the crescent moon on Tuesday 17 February - even using new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SAASST had said the first day of Ramadan would be Thursday 19 February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Abu Dhabi-based astronomer Mohammad Odeh, director of the International Astronomical Centre in Abu Dhabi and the Islamic Crescents Observation Project, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/ramadan-2026-warning-against-false-moon-sighting-information?_refresh=true&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the moon will not be visible on Tuesday in the UAE or Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Such reports, if they do occur, definitively confirm the error some individuals may make in mistakenly believing they have sighted a crescent moon that is not present in the sky,&quot; Odeh said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE and many other Muslim-majority countries, especially in the Gulf region, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/eid-2025-does-saudi-arabia-report-impossible-moonsightings&quot;&gt;customarily&lt;/a&gt; follow Saudi Arabia's lead with its moon-sightings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the comments from Emirati experts about the impossibility of a sighting, the UAE announced Ramadan for Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many experts had predicted that Saudi Arabia would declare Ramadan beginning on Wednesday regardless, as they have often announced sightings in previous years despite astronomers insisting the moon was not visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imad Ahmed, founder and director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/newcrescentsociety/&quot;&gt;New Crescent Society&lt;/a&gt;, an astronomy society that specialises in the Islamic calendar in the UK, runs an astronomy programme with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/planetarium-shows/astronomy-islam&quot;&gt;Royal Observatory in Greenwich&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;On Tuesday 17 February 2026, the crescent moon is astronomically impossible to see, whether by high powered telescopes or by the unaided eye anywhere in the Middle East - indeed, in the whole of Asia, Africa, or Europe,&quot; he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/will-uae-break-saudi-arabia-ramadan-start-date-moon-sighting&quot;&gt;told Middle East Eye last week&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His Majesty’s Nautical Almanac Office in the UK, a government body that produces astronomical data, said the moon would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/world-news/ramadan-2026-moonsighting-predictions-point-33407093&quot;&gt;not be visible&lt;/a&gt; in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in countries without official moon-sighting bodies, like the UK, many Muslims also follow Saudi Arabia’s lead, although some religious scholars in the Gulf kingdom have urged people elsewhere not to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing numbers of British Muslims are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/eid-2025-does-saudi-arabia-report-impossible-moonsightings&quot;&gt;opting&lt;/a&gt; for local moon sightings. Ahmed’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://newcrescentsociety.org/&quot;&gt;New Crescent Society&lt;/a&gt; carries out sightings across the country and aims to gather support for a unified Islamic calendar for Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Muslims across&amp;nbsp;the world, the holy month of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/ramadan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; is a time for religious reflection, increased worship, charity and community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observant Muslims abstain from all forms of food and drink between the hours of dawn and sunset whilst trying to reconnect with their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, Middle East Eye answers some of the most asked questions about the holy month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Ramadan and why do Muslims fast?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and amongst the most sacred for Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the month, Muslims are expected to fast if they are healthy and able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam and forms a core part of the religion. The other pillars are the declaration of faith, prayer, giving charity and going on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/hajj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hajj&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;pilgrimage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims believe that through fasting they are able to strengthen their relationship with God. Time is spent participating in acts of worship, such as praying, reading the Quran and giving charity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-mee-life mee-readmore-type-image align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-questions-not-even-water-too-embarrassed-ask&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; class=&quot;mee-readmore-image&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/ramadan-mali-afp-MICHELE-CATTANI.jpg.webp?itok=UedVPYkK&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;'Not even water?': Five Ramadan questions you may be too embarrassed to ask&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-questions-not-even-water-too-embarrassed-ask&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours allows Muslims to practise willpower and focus their energy on working on their faith. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting also allows Muslims to empathise with those who are less fortunate, and be more compassionate to those in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways a fast can be invalidated, including intentionally eating or drinking, intercourse and smoking. A woman cannot fast if she is menstruating.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question most Muslims get asked during Ramadan (alongside the infamous gasp of&amp;nbsp; &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-questions-not-even-water-too-embarrassed-ask&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not even water&lt;/a&gt;?&quot;) is what happens if you eat or drink by mistake? Can you not just take a sneaky swig when no one is looking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating or drinking intentionally invalidates your fast, as the purpose of Ramadan is to practise self-restraint and engage in religious acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, eating or drinking, if it is done through a genuine mistake, does not nullify your fast: followers can continue fasting as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why does the date of Ramadan change each year?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islam adheres to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/islamic-calendar-how-does-it-work-and-how-does-it-differ#:~:text=The%20Islamic%20calendar%20is%20governed,of%20a%20new%20crescent%20moon.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lunar calendar&lt;/a&gt;. This means that the month of Ramadan begins when the first crescent of a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/ramadan-moon-sighting-saudi-arabia-uk-muslims&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;moon is sighted&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lunar calendar is 10 to 11 days shorter than the modern 365-day Gregorian calendar, which is based on the Earth's rotation around the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difference means Ramadan begins on a different day each year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Muslim-majority countries, dedicated state committees check for the crescent moon and officially announce the start of Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in non-Muslim majority countries, there are different approaches: some Muslims follow a national mosque or reputable Islamic authority, whilst others follow the decision taken by Muslim-majority countries such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/saudi-arabia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan or India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When will it start this year?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and several other Gulf countries sighted the crescent moon on 17 February and declared 18 February as the first day of Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Jordan,&amp;nbsp;Oman and some other countries said the crescent moon was not sighted and therefore announced that Ramadan would begin on Thursday 19 February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the month of fasting will likely end on either Wednesday 18 March or Thursday 19 March, as there are either 29 or 30 days in a lunar month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Eid al-Fitr is likely to fall on either Thursday 19 March or Friday 20 March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eid al-Fitr, the festival of breaking of the fast, marks the end of Ramadan. Muslims tend to celebrate Eid with a small breakfast and give to charity before Eid prayers in congregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How long will Muslims be fasting for this year?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of each day's fast varies from place to place, depending on the number of daylight hours. It also varies with the time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take northern&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/tags/norway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;: if Ramadan falls one year in December, then each day's fast will be very short due to the limited amount of daylight near the North Pole at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the hours of fasting will increase in the same place during the summer, when there is near-perpetual daylight. In such circumstances there are rulings that allow for the local Muslim population to follow the hours of the nearest Muslim country or Mecca, home to Islam's holiest site, in&amp;nbsp;Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, each day of fasting can be as short as 11 hours or as long as 20 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, for instance those in London, can expect to fast between 12-14 hours, while in Ottawa,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/canada&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;they will be fasting more than 14 hours, whereas in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/tags/south-africa-1211294169&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;fasting time will be about 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How do Muslims prepare for Ramadan?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every family prepares for Ramadan differently. It is often a time for family and friends to get together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many will host&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/tags/iftar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iftars&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the meal which breaks the fast at the end of the day - at home and invite friends. Mosques typically host open iftars when anybody can come by and eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Click and drag to move&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Click and drag to move&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Many Muslims try to break bad habits before the start of Ramadan, to ease themselves into the month, prepare spiritually and take part in more charitable acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What happens on a typical day during Ramadan?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the month of Ramadan, Muslims will wake before the sun rises to eat a pre-dawn meal called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-suhoor-pre-dawn-meal-closer-look&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suhoor&lt;/a&gt;. They will then not eat or drink until sunset, when they will have iftar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iftar is followed by optional nightly prayers, known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-new-york-city-ramadan-tarawih-prayer-times-square&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tarawih&lt;/a&gt;, which go on into the night, if not into the early hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prayers usually take place at the mosque in large congregations but Muslims have the option to pray at home too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What are some key Ramadan traditions?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each day’s fast is typically broken by eating dates, which follows the tradition of the prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, people will pray Maghrib - one of the five daily prayers - and then sit down to eat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/meet-cairos-mesaharati-spirit-ramadan-beats-womans-drums&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;musaharati&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;will go down the streets with a drum to wake people for the pre-dawn meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What else are Muslims expected to do during Ramadan?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the holy month, Muslims are expected to engage in charitable acts, one of which is the obligatory zakat al-fitr, which is given at the end of Ramadan but before the Eid prayer (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of the donation is to cleanse the donor from any shortcomings conducted during the month and provide food for the needy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This payment is different to the zakat, which can be given at any time of year. It is one of the five pillars of Islam and equates to 2.5 percent of a full year's savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many Middle Eastern countries, Ramadan is prime time for the year's best&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-arab-tv-shows-six-things-learned&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt;, showcasing the most dramatic storylines and top celebrities, capitalising on the time people spend waiting for iftar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, many people choose the holy month to reduce the hours spent on entertainment, preferring instead to focus on studying the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 10 days of Ramadan are especially revered, with a focus on intense worship, as the first verses of the Quran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad during this period, which is&amp;nbsp;known as Laylat al-Qadr, Arabic for &quot;night of decree&quot; or &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/islam-laylat-qadr-night-power-holiest-night-explained&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;night of power&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the prophet never specified the exact date of the night, Muslims use those 10 days to increase their spirituality by reading and studying the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sacredness of Laylat al-Qadr is mentioned in the Quran, where it states that Laylat al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worshippers believe that praying with sincerity will allow their previous sins to be forgiven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Muslims choose to live and sleep in a mosque during this period - known as i'tikaaf - to focus on increasing their religious knowledge, staying in separate parts according to gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What happens at the end of Ramadan?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the holy month there is a three-day celebration known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/eid-al-fitr-2022-islam-muslims-end-of-ramadan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eid al-Fitr&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or, more commonly, Eid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Families will typically wake up early to go and pray in the mosque and greet friends, family and others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a time of food and festivities, when young children receive presents and homes are decorated to mark the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others also use the occasion to visit graveyards and pay their respects to loved ones who have passed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The far-right Restore Britain party was launched on Friday night in Great Yarmouth by former Reform MP Rupert Lowe and has been endorsed by Elon Musk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowe, a millionaire businessman and farmer who used to be chairman of Southampton FC, released an &quot;immigration policy&quot;, which he called &quot;deportation poetry&quot;, over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pledged to close off visa routes for &quot;Albania, Pakistan, Somalia, Eritrea, Afghanistan and plenty more&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will discriminate,&quot; Lowe proclaimed. &quot;We will look at the facts, and then discriminate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the MP was widely criticised after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/rupert-lowe-admits-putting-down-labrador-with-shotgun-b1234246.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revealing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;he asked his gamekeeper to shoot his 17-year-old dog in the back of the head at his estate in Gloucestershire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the dog, Cromwell, could no longer use his back legs and described his decision as &quot;humane&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;'Cousin marriages will be outlawed'&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowe was suspended from Reform in March last year after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/21/rupert-lowe-antisemitic-remark-parliament-meeting-reform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;it a &quot;protest party led by the Messiah&quot; and criticising Farage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the MP &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023304275217072259?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on X: &quot;Cousin marriages will be outlawed, so don’t even try and bring your wifecousin in from Pakistan. Not happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Restore Britain will not be putting forward any Bangladeshi candidates, I promise you that'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;- Rupert Lowe MP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;But if a British man wants to bring his American wife to Britain in order to build a life together, then we will encourage and enable that,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MP &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023304275217072259?s=20&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; a selective easing of &quot;fees and rules around spouse visas&quot; that would not apply to people from &quot;Pakistan, Albania, Bangladesh, Somalia, Afghanistan and many, many more&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023083380716327408?s=20&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for a &quot;total ban on all foreigners voting, or standing in elections&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Restore Britain will not be putting forward any Bangladeshi candidates, I promise you that,&quot; he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the party's campaigns director and spokesman, Charlie Downes, became embroiled in a social media argument with Matt Goodwin, Reform's parliamentary candidate in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downes &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GoodwinMJ/status/2023340610548105694?s=20&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Reform of deploying &quot;Regime attack lines when their electoral prospects are threatened by an authentically anti-establishment offering,&quot; after Goodwin criticised a far-right X account for mocking Sikh supporters of Reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Downes, Goodwin &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GoodwinMJ/status/2023340610548105694?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;You and many Restore people around you appear to be advocating blatant racism, calling to not just deport illegal migrants and foreign criminals (which is Reform policy) but throw out settled Brits who work hard, pay taxes, and play by the rules.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;Your ecosystem is riddled with white supremacists, antisemites, racists and conspiracy theorists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodwin himself has a long record of making controversial comments about ethnicity and Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most contentiously, he has repeatedly&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/jan/27/matthew-goodwin-gorton-and-denton-reform-uk-minorities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;insisted&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that British-born people with immigrant parents are not necessarily British.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance UK, led by former Reform deputy leader Ben Habib and backed by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/15/rupert-lowe-great-yarmouth-first-party-far-right-reform-uk&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it will consider a merger with Lowe's Restore Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restore Britain has said it will act as an umbrella political party that partners with locally based political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party could cause a headache for Farage and his Reform party by splitting the anti-immigration vote in many constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is necessary for Britain will be incredibly painful,&quot; Lowe &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023155273704103976?s=20&quot;&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. &quot;This is going to be the fight of our lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In meeting with Naqvi, Sri Lankan president appreciates Pakistan’s support during ‘difficult times’. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973707/in-meeting-with-naqvi-sri-lankan-president-appreciates-pakistans-support-during-difficult-times</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: In a meeting with a delegation from Pakistan on Monday, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appreciated Islamabad’s support during “difficult times”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan president shared photos of the meeting held in Colombo on social media platform X, saying that he had met Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Chaudhry Salik Hussain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We reaffirmed our enduring friendship [and] appreciated Pakistan’s support to Sri Lanka during difficult times,” the post by Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anuradisanayake/status/2023376056657559557&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further stated that the “Pakistan delegation conveyed special thanks from Pakistan’s president and prime minister for Sri Lanka’s timely intervention when Pakistan’s participation in the T20 [World Cup] was uncertain”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days ahead of the ongoing T20 global showpiece, the Pakistan government had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; that the country’s cricket team would not play against India in the group-stage match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision had come after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/in-phone-call-with-pm-sri-lanka-president-urges-pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india&quot;&gt;withdrew its decision&lt;/a&gt; to boycott the India match on February 9, saying: “The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the Bangladesh Cricket Board, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the withdrawal, PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Dissanayake. The Sri Lankan president urged Pakistan to play the match against India, in response to which PM Shehbaz said he would inform him about a “final decision” regarding the match after consultations, state-run &lt;em&gt;PTV News&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after Pakistan announced its decision to play the match, Dissanayake thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#joint-strategy-against-cybercrime-financial-fraud-mafia&quot; id=&quot;joint-strategy-against-cybercrime-financial-fraud-mafia&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Joint strategy against cybercrime, financial fraud mafia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Pakistan and Sri Lanka agreed to develop a joint strategy against cybercrimes and financial fraud mafias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The understanding was reached during a meeting of Naqvi with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a handout released by the Interior Ministry’s media wing, the meeting focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation and matters of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Ministers also discussed ways to enhance cooperation in internal security and joint efforts in counterterrorism and anti-narcotics operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎It was agreed to strengthen institutional collaboration between the interior ministries of Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The two sides also decided to improve coordination to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matters relating to joint training programs for police and paramilitary forces were also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi offered training opportunities for Sri Lankan police officers at the National Police Academy of Pakistan. He stated that officer exchange programs would enhance the professional capacity of forces in both countries and open new avenues of cooperation between the two ministries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also emphasised the need to expand collaboration to effectively combat cybercrime and financial crimes. Naqvi also invited the Sri Lankan minister to visit Pakistan and expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to him during his visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan minister welcomed Naqvi, stating that it was a matter of great pleasure for Sri Lanka and affirmed their commitment to promoting cooperation with Pakistan in areas of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#security-cooperation&quot; id=&quot;security-cooperation&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Security cooperation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi also met with Sri Lanka’s Secretary of Defence Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Sampatha Thuyacontha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting included discussions on Pakistan–Sri Lanka security cooperation and defence matters. Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to further enhance bilateral security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎The defence secretary acknowledged that Sri Lanka had also been a victim of terrorism and expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s steadfast support to the government in its fight against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi stated that security relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka had remained strong over the years and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening security cooperation with Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi also met Sri Lankan Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Sunil Kumara Gamage, with discussions focusing on enhancing cooperation in sports, particularly cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides agreed to strengthen collaboration between the respective sports ministries and promote bilateral cooperation in cricket and other sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi stated that cricket and other sports would further strengthen bilateral relations. He also appreciated the excellent arrangements made during the T20 World Cup and thanked the Sri Lankan authorities for their hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He extended an invitation to the Sri Lankan sports minister to visit Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Jackson Heights in New York buzzes with hope as Bangladesh embraces democracy. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973331/jackson-heights-in-new-york-buzzes-with-hope-as-bangladesh-embraces-democracy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: In New York, the Jackson Heights neighbourhood is alive with smells and sounds that evoke home: hilsa frying in mustard oil, &lt;em&gt;khajur gurr&lt;/em&gt; stacked beside jars of &lt;em&gt;achar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sari&lt;/em&gt; shops glittering with Tangail cottons and Jamdani silks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chatter of Bangla in every accent — from the clipped tones of Shudhu Bangla to the soft drawl of Noakhali and the rolling lilt of Chittagong — further authenticated the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants serving Bengali biryani and pakoras sit side by side with Pakistani eateries. Mosques are filled with worshippers preparing for Ramazan, with banners welcoming the holy month and offers of free iftar visible on doors and gates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vibrant diaspora community, the largest Bangladeshi settlement in North America, marked the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973288/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-thanks-those-who-fought-for-democracy&quot;&gt; elections&lt;/a&gt; and welcomed the results with a festive yet reflective mood. Residents had long participated in protests outside the United Nations headquarters against Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s government. The neighbourhood has Awami League supporters too, but most are silent for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are hoping that it will bring stability and prosperity to Bangladesh,” said Abul Hassan, a longtime shopkeeper. “We Bangladeshis have proven time and again that we do not tolerate tyranny. Hasina Wajed failed because she became a tyrant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan said most in Jackson Heights support the BNP, though some also admire Jamaat-e-Islami. Rasheed Ahmed, who runs a clothing store, called Jamaat’s success “a historic achievement for them anywhere in South Asia,” expressing hope it could play a constructive role in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#the-rise-of-political-islam&quot; id=&quot;the-rise-of-political-islam&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The rise of political Islam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s victory was widely expected in Jackson Heights too, even before the Awami League was barred from the contest, leaving Bangladesh’s largest opposition party with a clear path. Jamaat-e-Islami’s gain of around 70 seats, however, has stunned analysts and raised concerns about the rise of political Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taj Hashmi, a Toronto-based historian and Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, stressed the structural factors behind these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP’s win was predictable,” he said. “Eighteen years of political exclusion cannot erase deep-rooted grassroots networks. Anti-incumbency sentiment was enough to secure their return.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While a formidable party like the Awami League was absent from the poll (for the right or wrong reasons), it was obvious that it would benefit the largest political party, the BNP,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s surprising is that the Jamaat-e-Islami, who never ever polled more than 4 to 7 per cent of the vote in Bangladesh since 1979, has captured around 70 seats in the parliament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jamaat’s gains, he added: “The Jamaat’s rise reflects not only protest votes but the growing influence of political Islam among marginalised communities. Socioeconomic deprivation, unemployment, and decades of perceived injustice created fertile ground for their ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hashmi highlighted the party’s historical persecution: “Under Hasina, Jamaat leaders were executed or imprisoned on charges dating back to 1971. That repression, while intended to weaken them, instead fortified their narrative as a party of martyrs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was candid about the party’s ideology: “Jamaat’s intellectual roots lie in a vision of an Islamic state that is anti-individualist, and opposed to gender equality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding nuance, he noted: “Political Islam has been rising gradually, but it was exacerbated by Hasina’s heavy-handed rule. People seek alternatives, and even if Jamaat’s agenda is concerning, their parliamentary presence now is a reflection of deeper societal currents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Mohammad Imran Hossain, a visiting professor from Dhaka in New York, framed the elections in terms of regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In recent years, Bangladesh–Pakistan relations have been formal but cautious,” the executive director of Bangladesh Institute of Development and Security Studies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A BNP-led government could normalise ties incrementally, focusing on trade, flights, and pragmatic engagement — while still balancing the vital relationship with India.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Imran cautioned that changes would be measured: “Dramatic breakthroughs are unlikely. Progress depends on mutual respect and the ability to manage the legacy of 1971. If both sides see strategic value, relations could improve steadily within broader regional frameworks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imran also highlighted the domestic dimension: “The rise of Jamaat, while politically significant, could challenge governance. BNP will need to ensure democratic norms while integrating these actors responsibly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “The BNP’s foreign policy orientation will likely be pro-China and cautious toward India. That may unsettle New Delhi but could provide space for Bangladesh to diversify partnerships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations from Washington&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s congratulatory message sounded cautious and formal. “Congratulations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its leader Tarique Rahman as well as the people of Bangladesh. The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected government to advance prosperity and the security of the region,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN emphasised inclusive participation while noting intimidation and harassment of women candidates, including in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, described the process as peaceful, with strong turnout and no parties threatening to reject the results — a “significant step for democratisation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After off-field uproar settled, Pakistan set to clash with India. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973295/after-off-field-uproar-settled-pakistan-set-to-clash-with-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;COLOMBO: Brace yourself. Another Pakistan-India cricket blockbuster is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arch-rivals will clash in the T20 World Cup Group ‘A’ match in Colombo on Sunday, still feeling the aftershocks of a tumultuous fortnight in which Pakistan’s boycott call, which was later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt;, nearly blew a hole in the tournament’s marquee fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bilateral cricket a casualty of their fraught relations, emotions run high whenever the bitter neighbours lock horns in multi-team events at neutral venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s strained relations with another neighbour, Bangladesh, have further tangled the geopolitics around the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced by Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in the 20-team field for refusing to tour India over safety concerns, the regional chessboard shifted. The Pakistan government, in solidarity with Bangladesh, decided to boycott the match against India, a move that could jeopardise a highly lucrative fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan reversed its decision of the Feb 15 game boycott on Monday night only after hectic negotiations involving top officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board, International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly on cricketing merit, however, the rivalry has remained one-sided in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending champions India have a 7-1 record against Pakistan in the tournament’s history and they underlined that dominance at last year’s Asia Cup in the UAE. India beat Pakistan three times in that single event, including a stormy final marred by provocative gestures and snubbed handshakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘ALWAYS READY FOR INDIA’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan skipper Salman Agha said on Saturday his team had been “always ready” to face India on Sunday at the T20 World Cup, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Salman said ahead of the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were always ready for the game, whatever be the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against the Netherlands before beating the USA by 32 runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Salman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan skipper believed spin would dominate, calling off-spinner Usman Tariq his trump card against India’s powerful batting line-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usman has been bowling well and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Salman said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Usman’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been cleared twice so there are no worries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during the Asia Cup matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The game should be played in the true spirit of the game,” he said. “It has been the norm in cricket for years but whatever way they want, we will only know tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Pakistan and India have won their first two group stage matches, the winners of Sunday’s match will be guaranteed of their berth in the Super Eights round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT JUST ANOTHER GAME: SURYAKUMAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973199&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that no matter how much his team tried to prepare for Sunday’s T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan as “just another game”, it would be much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big platform, obviously,” Suryakumar told reporters in Colombo. “No matter how much you say that it’s just another game, it is a big game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper added, “We don’t play them often, don’t even play them regularly. But at the end of the day, we try to keep things simple and try to execute our best game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is pressure, but there is a big opportunity,” he continued. “According to me, when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suryakumar said opener Abhishek Sharma has recovered well from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972519&quot;&gt;stomach bug&lt;/a&gt; and was likely to play. The big-hitting 25-year-old, who skipped the Namibia match due to the health problem, batted in the nets on Saturday, which indicates the left-hander is in the frame for the high-octane Sunday clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian captain played down the hype around Usman’s bowling action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have practised with similar types of bowlers and similar actions so we will try to execute what we are practising in the night sessions,” said Suryakumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper would not say whether his players would shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts in Colombo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will break the suspense tomorrow,” he said. “Wait for 24 hours, let us play the game which is more important.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COMMENT: Oxygen of world cricket is back. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973299/comment-oxygen-of-world-cricket-is-back</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/6990f5b8366fd.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE cricket world held its breath for one week when Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970749&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to boycott its T20 World Cup group stage fixture against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with back-channel talks having broken the deadlock between the stakeholders, on Sunday evening at the R. Pre­madasa Stadium, it will exhale in one collective roar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan versus India in a T20 World Cup is not merely a match; it is the fixture that keeps the sport’s heartbeat strong. Whatever the result, the game will remind millions why they fell in love with cricket in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue itself is part of the narrative. The Premadasa Stadium has hosted many thrillers, but rarely one carrying this much baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan to face India today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A used pitch — likely the same surface on which Zimbabwe&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972974/zimbabwe-upset-australia-arsenal-drop-points-ratcliffe-under-review-dawn-news-english&quot;&gt; humbled &lt;/a&gt;Australia on Friday — awaits the two teams. It is slow, grippy and low. In such conditions the ball holds in the surface, turns a fraction and rewards the bowler who can vary pace and trajectory. Spin, not raw pace, will decide the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides have recognised the shift. India will lean on Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery, Axar Patel’s left-arm control and may also throw in Kuldeep Yadav’s wrist-spin — which has worried Pakistan over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will counter with a carousel of their own: Shadab Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and, most intriguingly, the 30-year-old off-spinner Usman Tariq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usman’s action has been the talk of the tournament. The brief pause at the crease, the low-arm sling, the ball that skids or dips — it has left batters guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has already been reported twice and cleared twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha calls him the “trump card”. In the spin-friendly Colombo air, that card could be decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Usman lands his variations on the money, even India’s middle order — Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rinku Singh — may find the boundaries suddenly distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Pakistan cannot rely on spin alone. The fast-bowling equation presents its own conundrum. Shaheen Shah Afridi remains the marquee name, the leader of the attack, the man who has delivered in big games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the left-arm seamer Salman Mirza has been impressive in the lead-up, generating swing and hitting the deck hard. Conditions on Sunday may not offer extravagant movement, yet the temptation to play both, or to prefer Mirza’s current rhythm over Shaheen’s experience, is real. The management must decide whether sentiment or data guides the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s batting, meanwhile, carries familiar vulnerabilities. The top order has fired in the first two matches, with Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub providing brisk starts. But Salman Agha and former skipper Babar Azam have to make better contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against India’s varied batting line-up, especially if Abhishek Sharma is fit, any collapse could prove fatal. Abhishek, the explosive left-hander, missed India’s game again Namibia with a stomach infection. He has since been cleared and insists he is fit. If he walks out at the top, the powerplay could belong to India in a hurry. Weather adds another layer of uncertainty. Colombo has been humid, and forecasts speak of a low-pressure system lingering over the Bay of Bengal. Morning and afternoon showers are possible; the evening is expected to be overcast but largely dry, with temperatures hovering around 27-28°C and humidity in the low-to-mid 70s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the field, the political backdrop is impossible to ignore. Only days ago Pakistan had threatened to boycott the contest in solidarity with Bangladesh after the latter’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;exclusion&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intensive negotiations in Lahore involving the International Cricket Council (ICC), the Pakistan Cricket Board and its Bangladesh counterpart produced a last-minute reversal as the ICC gave in to a few demands put forward by the PCB and the BCB. Now, fresh reports suggest that representatives of the BCB, PCB, the Afghanistan Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India may hold informal meetings on the sidelines of Sunday’s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether those conversations yield concrete results on bilateral cricket or future tournaments. But the very fact they are happening in Colombo underlines how deeply intertwined sport and diplomacy have become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the challenge is clear. They enter as slight underdogs India have won 13 of the last 16 T20I meetings yet the conditions are more even than at any recent clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premadasa Stadium is unlikely to be a 200-run ground on Sunday; 160-170 may be a fighting total. Discipline with the bat, control with the ball and, above all, composure under the weight of expectation will separate the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Shirts have the tools. Usman’s variations, the left-arm pace dilemma, a settled top order and the knowledge that they have already beaten strong sides in this tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But India remain the benchmark — clinical, deep and ruthless when the big moments arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come Sunday evening, 35,000 spectators will pack the Premadasa, millions more will tune in across the Subcontinent and beyond, and the world will remember why this fixture still matters. Win, lose or tie, cricket will be the richer for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxygen is back. Let the match begin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRICKET: REBALANCING CRICKET. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973281/cricket-rebalancing-cricket</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was never going to be easy for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to sideline Pakistan from the T20 World Cup, let alone exclude them from the marquee clash against India. That is precisely why, today on February 15, Pakistan will take on India for the ninth time in T20 World Cup history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a rivalry in which Pakistan has managed only one victory so far. Yet win numbers barely matter when these two teams meet, because this contest has grown far beyond cricket and has become arguably the most anticipated fixture in global sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the build-up to this match, uncertainty loomed large. Until just days before the game, there was no official confirmation that Pakistan would play. This followed a dramatic political intervention when the Government of Pakistan announced that it would not permit the Pakistan team to participate in the World Cup group-stage match against India. Despite the tournament featuring 20 teams, this single lucrative fixture dominated headlines across the cricketing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension had been sparked when Bangladesh approached the ICC, requesting that their World Cup matches be shifted out of India due to political and security concerns. The ICC rejected this request, citing operational challenges, and eventually removed Bangladesh from the tournament, replacing them with Scotland. This decision sent shockwaves through the cricket community and raised serious questions about fairness and consistency in governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most anticipated match in the ongoing T20 World Cup, Pakistan versus India today, almost didn’t happen. But the issue was always about more than a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Pakistan emerged as the only major cricketing nation willing to stand publicly in solidarity with Bangladesh. Pakistan’s position was rooted in recent precedent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2025 Champions Trophy, India refused to travel to Pakistan and the ICC allowed their matches to be played at a neutral venue in the UAE. Similarly, in the 2026 T20 World Cup, Pakistan was already playing all its matches in Sri Lanka rather than India. Given this background, many believed that Bangladesh deserved the same consideration rather than outright exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government took a firm stance and instructed the national team not to play India unless the issue was addressed. This moment marked a rare instance of a powerful cricket board openly challenging both the ICC and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sky Sports, former England captain and respected commentator Nasser Hussain weighed in on the controversy. He remarked that it was difficult to imagine the ICC treating India the same way if they had refused to play in a host country at short notice. He further stated that Pakistan was speaking to the ICC and BCCI in the only language that truly moves world cricket, financial leverage and commercial reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hussain also expressed admiration for both Bangladesh and Pakistan, praising Bangladesh for taking a principled stand and Pakistan for defending another full member of the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation reached a turning point on Sunday, February 8, when the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president and the ICC deputy chairman travelled to Pakistan for high-level talks with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi. These discussions proved crucial and, by Monday evening, a resolution began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting, the BCB formally requested Pakistan to proceed with the match against India on February 15. Shortly after, the ICC issued a detailed press release outlining key assurances, including recognition of Bangladesh as a valued full member with a proud cricketing heritage, confirmation that their absence from the 2026 World Cup would not harm their long-term cricketing future and a commitment to continue supporting cricket development in Bangladesh, a nation of over 200 million passionate fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the ICC confirmed that no financial, sporting or administrative penalties would be imposed on Bangladesh. The BCB also retained the right to approach the ICC Dispute Resolution Committee if it chose to do so. Additionally, Bangladesh was guaranteed hosting rights for an ICC event between 2028 and 2031, ahead of the 2031 Men’s Cricket World Cup, subject to standard procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this resolution, the Government of Pakistan officially announced on social media platform X that Pakistan would indeed play India today. This marked a historic moment in cricket diplomacy, where one board stood up for another in the name of fairness and equality among ICC members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this positive outcome, a misleading narrative began circulating in the Indian media. Several outlets portrayed Pakistan as backing down or surrendering under pressure. This interpretation was far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that India versus Pakistan matches in ICC tournaments generate immense global viewership and revenue. Broadcasters, sponsors, the ICC, BCCI and PCB all benefit significantly from this rivalry. Even during periods of intense public hostility, such as the 2025 Asia Cup, India ultimately played Pakistan despite political tensions at home. At that time, Indian players refused to shake hands as a symbolic gesture, yet they still participated because a full boycott was simply not commercially viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made this situation different was that Pakistan became the first team to openly risk financial losses and potential ICC sanctions by threatening to withdraw from the biggest match in world cricket. This was not a retreat but a calculated stand based on principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the ICC was never in a position to simply remove or punish Pakistan the way it did with Bangladesh, even though this was exactly what many in India, particularly sections of Indian media and officials close to the BCCI, were hoping for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicking Pakistan out of a global event was never going to be straightforward, because Pakistan is one half of the biggest rivalry in world cricket, a rivalry that generates enormous revenue, viewership, sponsorship and broadcast value for every ICC tournament. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The India versus Pakistan contest is not just another match, it is one of the most commercially powerful fixtures in international sport and the entire financial model of ICC events benefits heavily from its existence. Broadcasters pay premium rights fees largely because of this match-up. Sponsors invest more when these two teams meet. And host countries rely on this game to maximise ticket sales and global engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the ICC had to handle Pakistan’s stance with far greater caution and diplomacy than it did with Bangladesh, as any harsh action against Pakistan would have directly damaged the tournament’s commercial appeal and credibility. Unlike Bangladesh, Pakistan sits at the centre of the most profitable rivalry in cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, all three parties, Pakistan, India and the ICC, ultimately wanted this match to go ahead. However, Pakistan ensured that the ICC and BCCI acknowledged the need for fair treatment of all member nations rather than selective enforcement based on power or politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, this episode became a win-win situation. Bangladesh secured a future ICC hosting opportunity without any penalties, while Pakistan demonstrated leadership, solidarity and moral courage. More importantly, Pakistan proved that it is not merely a participant in world cricket but a nation willing to challenge the system when fairness is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not just about a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket. And on that front, Pakistan emerged with its reputation not only intact but strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Population surge threatens growth, warns Aurangzeb. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973310/population-surge-threatens-growth-warns-aurangzeb</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Insists govt can’t create jobs for millions of people; private sector must lead employment drive&lt;br /&gt;
• Claims FIR registered against sitting senator over alleged tax evasion&lt;br /&gt;
• Says tobacco sector ‘not paying taxes’, involved in smuggling&lt;br /&gt;
• Construction relief package ‘in pipeline’, announcement expected soon&lt;br /&gt;
• Textile support under review; minister seeks 10-12 days for concrete steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb on Saturday warned that Pakistan could not be run with a rapidly increasing population and stressed that the private sector would have to take the lead and create employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If this growth rate (2.5pc) continues, our population can reach 400 million in the coming years. So, you tell us who will run this country in such a situation,” he said while speaking at the Pakistan Economic Growth Conference at the regional office of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Lahore. “So please help us on how to control the population,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On employment, the minister said the government alone could not provide jobs to the entire population of 250 million. “The private sector should lead the country’s economy and provide jobs,” he said, adding that the government’s role was to strengthen and enable the private sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister emphasised the need to adopt the strategy that Bangladesh had used to control its population. “When you talk about Bangladesh with reference to taxation, competitiveness, growth, etc, while comparing with Pakistan, why don’t you talk about its journey to control population,” he questioned, requesting the businesspersons to come forward and help the government reduce the population growth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aurangzeb said the government was making efforts to broaden the tax base, claiming that an FIR had been registered against a sitting senator over alleged tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tobacco and cigarette companies, except for two, are not paying taxes. They are also involved in smuggling. But we are not sparing them. We got an FIR even against a sitting senator,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the government had started monitoring sales tax on goods starting with the sugar industry and would move to other sectors in phases. “The PM has instructed us to start this from the sugar industry since his family is engaged in this [sugar] business,” Mr Aurangzeb claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finance minister said that after economic stabilisation, industrialisation was essential for sustainable growth and reiterated that the government was pursuing an export-led policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said relief measures for the construction sector were in the pipeline and would soon be announced by the prime minister, while support for the textile sector and possible reductions in taxes linked to the property sector were also under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said digitisation would improve transparency and revenue collection and acknowledged that the salaried class bore a disproportionate share of the tax burden. He reiterated the government’s commitment to providing relief to salaried individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting developments in the construction sector, the finance minister said the work was actively underway and efforts were being made to broaden the tax net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clarified that the real estate and construction sectors were being treated separately, adding that construction was linked with multiple allied industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He assured the business community that their issues would be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the textile sector, he said that its issues were currently under review and requested 10 to 12 more days, assuring that concrete steps would be announced shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further stated that the government was reviewing the possibility of reducing multiple taxes in the property sector while carefully balancing fiscal responsibilities with sectoral demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aurangzeb said that the positive impact of Pakistan’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has begun to materialise, restoring the confidence of international financial institutions in Pakistan’s economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the country was now firmly on the path of stability and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that difficult but necessary decisions were taken to ensure fiscal discipline, particularly when Pakistan faced the risk of default. While the 2022 floods severely affected the economy, he said the country had sufficient capacity to absorb the losses caused by the 2025 floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finance minister described IT exports as the future of Pakistan’s economy, stating that current IT exports stood at $3-4 billion, with the potential to reach $8-10bn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stressed that export proceeds must be fully repatriated, as a significant portion — around $4-5bn — was currently retained abroad. He further stated that foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan were increasing consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Due to prudent government policies, inflation has declined to record lows, providing tangible relief to the general public,” he said, reiterating that the salaried class would continue to receive priority relief measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, former minister Gohar Ejaz expressed concern over heavy taxation on real estate and other sectors, saying it was pushing investment abroad, particularly to Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pakistani people have already purchased properties worth $100bn in Dubai. A property expo for investment in Dubai is also being held in Lahore. And this city, after Karachi and other major cities, will be empty soon,” he deplored, requesting the government to reduce taxes on real estate and other sectors for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

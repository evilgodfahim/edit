&lt;p&gt;The far-right Restore Britain party was launched on Friday night in Great Yarmouth by former Reform MP Rupert Lowe and has been endorsed by Elon Musk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowe, a millionaire businessman and farmer who used to be chairman of Southampton FC, released an &quot;immigration policy&quot;, which he called &quot;deportation poetry&quot;, over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pledged to close off visa routes for &quot;Albania, Pakistan, Somalia, Eritrea, Afghanistan and plenty more&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will discriminate,&quot; Lowe proclaimed. &quot;We will look at the facts, and then discriminate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Lowe&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023386586864386140?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the party would &quot;abolish the entire asylum systems&quot;, adding: &quot;No more asylum seekers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party has &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RestoreBritain_/status/2023306233219068141?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it has more than 50,000 members already. Over the weekend, Lowe &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2022580807336911236?s=20&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that a Restore Britain government would ban non-stun halal and kosher slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Britain, we treat our animals with care - we do not brutally butcher them alive,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the MP was widely criticised after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/rupert-lowe-admits-putting-down-labrador-with-shotgun-b1234246.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revealing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;he asked his gamekeeper to shoot his 17-year-old dog in the back of the head at his estate in Gloucestershire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the dog, Cromwell, could no longer use his back legs and described his decision as &quot;humane&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;'Cousin marriages will be outlawed'&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowe was suspended from Reform in March last year after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/21/rupert-lowe-antisemitic-remark-parliament-meeting-reform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;it a &quot;protest party led by the Messiah&quot; and criticising Farage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the MP &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023304275217072259?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on X: &quot;Cousin marriages will be outlawed, so don’t even try and bring your wifecousin in from Pakistan. Not happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Restore Britain will not be putting forward any Bangladeshi candidates, I promise you that'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;- Rupert Lowe MP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;But if a British man wants to bring his American wife to Britain in order to build a life together, then we will encourage and enable that,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MP &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023304275217072259?s=20&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; a selective easing of &quot;fees and rules around spouse visas&quot; that would not apply to people from &quot;Pakistan, Albania, Bangladesh, Somalia, Afghanistan and many, many more&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023083380716327408?s=20&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for a &quot;total ban on all foreigners voting, or standing in elections&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Restore Britain will not be putting forward any Bangladeshi candidates, I promise you that,&quot; he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the party's campaigns director and spokesman, Charlie Downes, became embroiled in a social media argument with Matt Goodwin, Reform's parliamentary candidate in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downes &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GoodwinMJ/status/2023340610548105694?s=20&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Reform of deploying &quot;Regime attack lines when their electoral prospects are threatened by an authentically anti-establishment offering,&quot; after Goodwin criticised a far-right X account for mocking Sikh supporters of Reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Downes, Goodwin &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GoodwinMJ/status/2023340610548105694?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;You and many Restore people around you appear to be advocating blatant racism, calling to not just deport illegal migrants and foreign criminals (which is Reform policy) but throw out settled Brits who work hard, pay taxes, and play by the rules.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;Your ecosystem is riddled with white supremacists, antisemites, racists and conspiracy theorists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodwin himself has a long record of making controversial comments about ethnicity and Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most contentiously, he has repeatedly&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/jan/27/matthew-goodwin-gorton-and-denton-reform-uk-minorities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;insisted&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that British-born people with immigrant parents are not necessarily British.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance UK, led by former Reform deputy leader Ben Habib and backed by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/15/rupert-lowe-great-yarmouth-first-party-far-right-reform-uk&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it will consider a merger with Lowe's Restore Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restore Britain has said it will act as an umbrella political party that partners with locally based political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party could cause a headache for Farage and his Reform party by splitting the anti-immigration vote in many constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is necessary for Britain will be incredibly painful,&quot; Lowe &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023155273704103976?s=20&quot;&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. &quot;This is going to be the fight of our lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In meeting with Naqvi, Sri Lankan president appreciates Pakistan’s support during ‘difficult times’. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973707/in-meeting-with-naqvi-sri-lankan-president-appreciates-pakistans-support-during-difficult-times</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: In a meeting with a delegation from Pakistan on Monday, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appreciated Islamabad’s support during “difficult times”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan president shared photos of the meeting held in Colombo on social media platform X, saying that he had met Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Chaudhry Salik Hussain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We reaffirmed our enduring friendship [and] appreciated Pakistan’s support to Sri Lanka during difficult times,” the post by Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anuradisanayake/status/2023376056657559557&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further stated that the “Pakistan delegation conveyed special thanks from Pakistan’s president and prime minister for Sri Lanka’s timely intervention when Pakistan’s participation in the T20 [World Cup] was uncertain”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days ahead of the ongoing T20 global showpiece, the Pakistan government had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; that the country’s cricket team would not play against India in the group-stage match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision had come after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/in-phone-call-with-pm-sri-lanka-president-urges-pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india&quot;&gt;withdrew its decision&lt;/a&gt; to boycott the India match on February 9, saying: “The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the Bangladesh Cricket Board, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the withdrawal, PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Dissanayake. The Sri Lankan president urged Pakistan to play the match against India, in response to which PM Shehbaz said he would inform him about a “final decision” regarding the match after consultations, state-run &lt;em&gt;PTV News&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after Pakistan announced its decision to play the match, Dissanayake thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#joint-strategy-against-cybercrime-financial-fraud-mafia&quot; id=&quot;joint-strategy-against-cybercrime-financial-fraud-mafia&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Joint strategy against cybercrime, financial fraud mafia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Pakistan and Sri Lanka agreed to develop a joint strategy against cybercrimes and financial fraud mafias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The understanding was reached during a meeting of Naqvi with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a handout released by the Interior Ministry’s media wing, the meeting focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation and matters of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Ministers also discussed ways to enhance cooperation in internal security and joint efforts in counterterrorism and anti-narcotics operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎It was agreed to strengthen institutional collaboration between the interior ministries of Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The two sides also decided to improve coordination to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matters relating to joint training programs for police and paramilitary forces were also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi offered training opportunities for Sri Lankan police officers at the National Police Academy of Pakistan. He stated that officer exchange programs would enhance the professional capacity of forces in both countries and open new avenues of cooperation between the two ministries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also emphasised the need to expand collaboration to effectively combat cybercrime and financial crimes. Naqvi also invited the Sri Lankan minister to visit Pakistan and expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to him during his visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan minister welcomed Naqvi, stating that it was a matter of great pleasure for Sri Lanka and affirmed their commitment to promoting cooperation with Pakistan in areas of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#security-cooperation&quot; id=&quot;security-cooperation&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Security cooperation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi also met with Sri Lanka’s Secretary of Defence Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Sampatha Thuyacontha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting included discussions on Pakistan–Sri Lanka security cooperation and defence matters. Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to further enhance bilateral security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎The defence secretary acknowledged that Sri Lanka had also been a victim of terrorism and expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s steadfast support to the government in its fight against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla will represent India at the swearing-in of Bangladesh's PM-elect Tarique Rahman, following the BNP's landslide victory. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri will accompany Birla. This event marks a significant diplomatic shift for Dhaka, especially after former PM Sheikh Hasina's ouster and subsequent exile in India. The new BNP government's stance will be closely observed.</description>

      <title>Jackson Heights in New York buzzes with hope as Bangladesh embraces democracy. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973331/jackson-heights-in-new-york-buzzes-with-hope-as-bangladesh-embraces-democracy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: In New York, the Jackson Heights neighbourhood is alive with smells and sounds that evoke home: hilsa frying in mustard oil, &lt;em&gt;khajur gurr&lt;/em&gt; stacked beside jars of &lt;em&gt;achar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sari&lt;/em&gt; shops glittering with Tangail cottons and Jamdani silks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chatter of Bangla in every accent — from the clipped tones of Shudhu Bangla to the soft drawl of Noakhali and the rolling lilt of Chittagong — further authenticated the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants serving Bengali biryani and pakoras sit side by side with Pakistani eateries. Mosques are filled with worshippers preparing for Ramazan, with banners welcoming the holy month and offers of free iftar visible on doors and gates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vibrant diaspora community, the largest Bangladeshi settlement in North America, marked the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973288/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-thanks-those-who-fought-for-democracy&quot;&gt; elections&lt;/a&gt; and welcomed the results with a festive yet reflective mood. Residents had long participated in protests outside the United Nations headquarters against Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s government. The neighbourhood has Awami League supporters too, but most are silent for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are hoping that it will bring stability and prosperity to Bangladesh,” said Abul Hassan, a longtime shopkeeper. “We Bangladeshis have proven time and again that we do not tolerate tyranny. Hasina Wajed failed because she became a tyrant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan said most in Jackson Heights support the BNP, though some also admire Jamaat-e-Islami. Rasheed Ahmed, who runs a clothing store, called Jamaat’s success “a historic achievement for them anywhere in South Asia,” expressing hope it could play a constructive role in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#the-rise-of-political-islam&quot; id=&quot;the-rise-of-political-islam&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The rise of political Islam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s victory was widely expected in Jackson Heights too, even before the Awami League was barred from the contest, leaving Bangladesh’s largest opposition party with a clear path. Jamaat-e-Islami’s gain of around 70 seats, however, has stunned analysts and raised concerns about the rise of political Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taj Hashmi, a Toronto-based historian and Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, stressed the structural factors behind these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP’s win was predictable,” he said. “Eighteen years of political exclusion cannot erase deep-rooted grassroots networks. Anti-incumbency sentiment was enough to secure their return.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While a formidable party like the Awami League was absent from the poll (for the right or wrong reasons), it was obvious that it would benefit the largest political party, the BNP,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s surprising is that the Jamaat-e-Islami, who never ever polled more than 4 to 7 per cent of the vote in Bangladesh since 1979, has captured around 70 seats in the parliament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jamaat’s gains, he added: “The Jamaat’s rise reflects not only protest votes but the growing influence of political Islam among marginalised communities. Socioeconomic deprivation, unemployment, and decades of perceived injustice created fertile ground for their ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hashmi highlighted the party’s historical persecution: “Under Hasina, Jamaat leaders were executed or imprisoned on charges dating back to 1971. That repression, while intended to weaken them, instead fortified their narrative as a party of martyrs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was candid about the party’s ideology: “Jamaat’s intellectual roots lie in a vision of an Islamic state that is anti-individualist, and opposed to gender equality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding nuance, he noted: “Political Islam has been rising gradually, but it was exacerbated by Hasina’s heavy-handed rule. People seek alternatives, and even if Jamaat’s agenda is concerning, their parliamentary presence now is a reflection of deeper societal currents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Mohammad Imran Hossain, a visiting professor from Dhaka in New York, framed the elections in terms of regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In recent years, Bangladesh–Pakistan relations have been formal but cautious,” the executive director of Bangladesh Institute of Development and Security Studies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A BNP-led government could normalise ties incrementally, focusing on trade, flights, and pragmatic engagement — while still balancing the vital relationship with India.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Imran cautioned that changes would be measured: “Dramatic breakthroughs are unlikely. Progress depends on mutual respect and the ability to manage the legacy of 1971. If both sides see strategic value, relations could improve steadily within broader regional frameworks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imran also highlighted the domestic dimension: “The rise of Jamaat, while politically significant, could challenge governance. BNP will need to ensure democratic norms while integrating these actors responsibly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “The BNP’s foreign policy orientation will likely be pro-China and cautious toward India. That may unsettle New Delhi but could provide space for Bangladesh to diversify partnerships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations from Washington&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s congratulatory message sounded cautious and formal. “Congratulations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its leader Tarique Rahman as well as the people of Bangladesh. The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected government to advance prosperity and the security of the region,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN emphasised inclusive participation while noting intimidation and harassment of women candidates, including in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, described the process as peaceful, with strong turnout and no parties threatening to reject the results — a “significant step for democratisation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After off-field uproar settled, Pakistan set to clash with India. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973295/after-off-field-uproar-settled-pakistan-set-to-clash-with-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;COLOMBO: Brace yourself. Another Pakistan-India cricket blockbuster is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arch-rivals will clash in the T20 World Cup Group ‘A’ match in Colombo on Sunday, still feeling the aftershocks of a tumultuous fortnight in which Pakistan’s boycott call, which was later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt;, nearly blew a hole in the tournament’s marquee fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bilateral cricket a casualty of their fraught relations, emotions run high whenever the bitter neighbours lock horns in multi-team events at neutral venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s strained relations with another neighbour, Bangladesh, have further tangled the geopolitics around the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced by Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in the 20-team field for refusing to tour India over safety concerns, the regional chessboard shifted. The Pakistan government, in solidarity with Bangladesh, decided to boycott the match against India, a move that could jeopardise a highly lucrative fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan reversed its decision of the Feb 15 game boycott on Monday night only after hectic negotiations involving top officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board, International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly on cricketing merit, however, the rivalry has remained one-sided in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending champions India have a 7-1 record against Pakistan in the tournament’s history and they underlined that dominance at last year’s Asia Cup in the UAE. India beat Pakistan three times in that single event, including a stormy final marred by provocative gestures and snubbed handshakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘ALWAYS READY FOR INDIA’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan skipper Salman Agha said on Saturday his team had been “always ready” to face India on Sunday at the T20 World Cup, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Salman said ahead of the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were always ready for the game, whatever be the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against the Netherlands before beating the USA by 32 runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Salman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan skipper believed spin would dominate, calling off-spinner Usman Tariq his trump card against India’s powerful batting line-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usman has been bowling well and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Salman said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Usman’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been cleared twice so there are no worries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during the Asia Cup matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The game should be played in the true spirit of the game,” he said. “It has been the norm in cricket for years but whatever way they want, we will only know tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Pakistan and India have won their first two group stage matches, the winners of Sunday’s match will be guaranteed of their berth in the Super Eights round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT JUST ANOTHER GAME: SURYAKUMAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973199&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that no matter how much his team tried to prepare for Sunday’s T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan as “just another game”, it would be much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big platform, obviously,” Suryakumar told reporters in Colombo. “No matter how much you say that it’s just another game, it is a big game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper added, “We don’t play them often, don’t even play them regularly. But at the end of the day, we try to keep things simple and try to execute our best game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is pressure, but there is a big opportunity,” he continued. “According to me, when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suryakumar said opener Abhishek Sharma has recovered well from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972519&quot;&gt;stomach bug&lt;/a&gt; and was likely to play. The big-hitting 25-year-old, who skipped the Namibia match due to the health problem, batted in the nets on Saturday, which indicates the left-hander is in the frame for the high-octane Sunday clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian captain played down the hype around Usman’s bowling action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have practised with similar types of bowlers and similar actions so we will try to execute what we are practising in the night sessions,” said Suryakumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper would not say whether his players would shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts in Colombo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will break the suspense tomorrow,” he said. “Wait for 24 hours, let us play the game which is more important.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COMMENT: Oxygen of world cricket is back. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973299/comment-oxygen-of-world-cricket-is-back</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/6990f5b8366fd.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE cricket world held its breath for one week when Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970749&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to boycott its T20 World Cup group stage fixture against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with back-channel talks having broken the deadlock between the stakeholders, on Sunday evening at the R. Pre­madasa Stadium, it will exhale in one collective roar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan versus India in a T20 World Cup is not merely a match; it is the fixture that keeps the sport’s heartbeat strong. Whatever the result, the game will remind millions why they fell in love with cricket in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue itself is part of the narrative. The Premadasa Stadium has hosted many thrillers, but rarely one carrying this much baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan to face India today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A used pitch — likely the same surface on which Zimbabwe&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972974/zimbabwe-upset-australia-arsenal-drop-points-ratcliffe-under-review-dawn-news-english&quot;&gt; humbled &lt;/a&gt;Australia on Friday — awaits the two teams. It is slow, grippy and low. In such conditions the ball holds in the surface, turns a fraction and rewards the bowler who can vary pace and trajectory. Spin, not raw pace, will decide the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides have recognised the shift. India will lean on Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery, Axar Patel’s left-arm control and may also throw in Kuldeep Yadav’s wrist-spin — which has worried Pakistan over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will counter with a carousel of their own: Shadab Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and, most intriguingly, the 30-year-old off-spinner Usman Tariq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usman’s action has been the talk of the tournament. The brief pause at the crease, the low-arm sling, the ball that skids or dips — it has left batters guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has already been reported twice and cleared twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha calls him the “trump card”. In the spin-friendly Colombo air, that card could be decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Usman lands his variations on the money, even India’s middle order — Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rinku Singh — may find the boundaries suddenly distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Pakistan cannot rely on spin alone. The fast-bowling equation presents its own conundrum. Shaheen Shah Afridi remains the marquee name, the leader of the attack, the man who has delivered in big games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the left-arm seamer Salman Mirza has been impressive in the lead-up, generating swing and hitting the deck hard. Conditions on Sunday may not offer extravagant movement, yet the temptation to play both, or to prefer Mirza’s current rhythm over Shaheen’s experience, is real. The management must decide whether sentiment or data guides the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s batting, meanwhile, carries familiar vulnerabilities. The top order has fired in the first two matches, with Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub providing brisk starts. But Salman Agha and former skipper Babar Azam have to make better contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against India’s varied batting line-up, especially if Abhishek Sharma is fit, any collapse could prove fatal. Abhishek, the explosive left-hander, missed India’s game again Namibia with a stomach infection. He has since been cleared and insists he is fit. If he walks out at the top, the powerplay could belong to India in a hurry. Weather adds another layer of uncertainty. Colombo has been humid, and forecasts speak of a low-pressure system lingering over the Bay of Bengal. Morning and afternoon showers are possible; the evening is expected to be overcast but largely dry, with temperatures hovering around 27-28°C and humidity in the low-to-mid 70s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the field, the political backdrop is impossible to ignore. Only days ago Pakistan had threatened to boycott the contest in solidarity with Bangladesh after the latter’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;exclusion&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intensive negotiations in Lahore involving the International Cricket Council (ICC), the Pakistan Cricket Board and its Bangladesh counterpart produced a last-minute reversal as the ICC gave in to a few demands put forward by the PCB and the BCB. Now, fresh reports suggest that representatives of the BCB, PCB, the Afghanistan Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India may hold informal meetings on the sidelines of Sunday’s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether those conversations yield concrete results on bilateral cricket or future tournaments. But the very fact they are happening in Colombo underlines how deeply intertwined sport and diplomacy have become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the challenge is clear. They enter as slight underdogs India have won 13 of the last 16 T20I meetings yet the conditions are more even than at any recent clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premadasa Stadium is unlikely to be a 200-run ground on Sunday; 160-170 may be a fighting total. Discipline with the bat, control with the ball and, above all, composure under the weight of expectation will separate the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Shirts have the tools. Usman’s variations, the left-arm pace dilemma, a settled top order and the knowledge that they have already beaten strong sides in this tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But India remain the benchmark — clinical, deep and ruthless when the big moments arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come Sunday evening, 35,000 spectators will pack the Premadasa, millions more will tune in across the Subcontinent and beyond, and the world will remember why this fixture still matters. Win, lose or tie, cricket will be the richer for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxygen is back. Let the match begin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRICKET: REBALANCING CRICKET. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973281/cricket-rebalancing-cricket</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was never going to be easy for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to sideline Pakistan from the T20 World Cup, let alone exclude them from the marquee clash against India. That is precisely why, today on February 15, Pakistan will take on India for the ninth time in T20 World Cup history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a rivalry in which Pakistan has managed only one victory so far. Yet win numbers barely matter when these two teams meet, because this contest has grown far beyond cricket and has become arguably the most anticipated fixture in global sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the build-up to this match, uncertainty loomed large. Until just days before the game, there was no official confirmation that Pakistan would play. This followed a dramatic political intervention when the Government of Pakistan announced that it would not permit the Pakistan team to participate in the World Cup group-stage match against India. Despite the tournament featuring 20 teams, this single lucrative fixture dominated headlines across the cricketing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension had been sparked when Bangladesh approached the ICC, requesting that their World Cup matches be shifted out of India due to political and security concerns. The ICC rejected this request, citing operational challenges, and eventually removed Bangladesh from the tournament, replacing them with Scotland. This decision sent shockwaves through the cricket community and raised serious questions about fairness and consistency in governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most anticipated match in the ongoing T20 World Cup, Pakistan versus India today, almost didn’t happen. But the issue was always about more than a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Pakistan emerged as the only major cricketing nation willing to stand publicly in solidarity with Bangladesh. Pakistan’s position was rooted in recent precedent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2025 Champions Trophy, India refused to travel to Pakistan and the ICC allowed their matches to be played at a neutral venue in the UAE. Similarly, in the 2026 T20 World Cup, Pakistan was already playing all its matches in Sri Lanka rather than India. Given this background, many believed that Bangladesh deserved the same consideration rather than outright exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government took a firm stance and instructed the national team not to play India unless the issue was addressed. This moment marked a rare instance of a powerful cricket board openly challenging both the ICC and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sky Sports, former England captain and respected commentator Nasser Hussain weighed in on the controversy. He remarked that it was difficult to imagine the ICC treating India the same way if they had refused to play in a host country at short notice. He further stated that Pakistan was speaking to the ICC and BCCI in the only language that truly moves world cricket, financial leverage and commercial reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hussain also expressed admiration for both Bangladesh and Pakistan, praising Bangladesh for taking a principled stand and Pakistan for defending another full member of the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation reached a turning point on Sunday, February 8, when the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president and the ICC deputy chairman travelled to Pakistan for high-level talks with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi. These discussions proved crucial and, by Monday evening, a resolution began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting, the BCB formally requested Pakistan to proceed with the match against India on February 15. Shortly after, the ICC issued a detailed press release outlining key assurances, including recognition of Bangladesh as a valued full member with a proud cricketing heritage, confirmation that their absence from the 2026 World Cup would not harm their long-term cricketing future and a commitment to continue supporting cricket development in Bangladesh, a nation of over 200 million passionate fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the ICC confirmed that no financial, sporting or administrative penalties would be imposed on Bangladesh. The BCB also retained the right to approach the ICC Dispute Resolution Committee if it chose to do so. Additionally, Bangladesh was guaranteed hosting rights for an ICC event between 2028 and 2031, ahead of the 2031 Men’s Cricket World Cup, subject to standard procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this resolution, the Government of Pakistan officially announced on social media platform X that Pakistan would indeed play India today. This marked a historic moment in cricket diplomacy, where one board stood up for another in the name of fairness and equality among ICC members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this positive outcome, a misleading narrative began circulating in the Indian media. Several outlets portrayed Pakistan as backing down or surrendering under pressure. This interpretation was far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that India versus Pakistan matches in ICC tournaments generate immense global viewership and revenue. Broadcasters, sponsors, the ICC, BCCI and PCB all benefit significantly from this rivalry. Even during periods of intense public hostility, such as the 2025 Asia Cup, India ultimately played Pakistan despite political tensions at home. At that time, Indian players refused to shake hands as a symbolic gesture, yet they still participated because a full boycott was simply not commercially viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made this situation different was that Pakistan became the first team to openly risk financial losses and potential ICC sanctions by threatening to withdraw from the biggest match in world cricket. This was not a retreat but a calculated stand based on principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the ICC was never in a position to simply remove or punish Pakistan the way it did with Bangladesh, even though this was exactly what many in India, particularly sections of Indian media and officials close to the BCCI, were hoping for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicking Pakistan out of a global event was never going to be straightforward, because Pakistan is one half of the biggest rivalry in world cricket, a rivalry that generates enormous revenue, viewership, sponsorship and broadcast value for every ICC tournament. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The India versus Pakistan contest is not just another match, it is one of the most commercially powerful fixtures in international sport and the entire financial model of ICC events benefits heavily from its existence. Broadcasters pay premium rights fees largely because of this match-up. Sponsors invest more when these two teams meet. And host countries rely on this game to maximise ticket sales and global engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the ICC had to handle Pakistan’s stance with far greater caution and diplomacy than it did with Bangladesh, as any harsh action against Pakistan would have directly damaged the tournament’s commercial appeal and credibility. Unlike Bangladesh, Pakistan sits at the centre of the most profitable rivalry in cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, all three parties, Pakistan, India and the ICC, ultimately wanted this match to go ahead. However, Pakistan ensured that the ICC and BCCI acknowledged the need for fair treatment of all member nations rather than selective enforcement based on power or politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, this episode became a win-win situation. Bangladesh secured a future ICC hosting opportunity without any penalties, while Pakistan demonstrated leadership, solidarity and moral courage. More importantly, Pakistan proved that it is not merely a participant in world cricket but a nation willing to challenge the system when fairness is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not just about a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket. And on that front, Pakistan emerged with its reputation not only intact but strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Population surge threatens growth, warns Aurangzeb. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973310/population-surge-threatens-growth-warns-aurangzeb</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Insists govt can’t create jobs for millions of people; private sector must lead employment drive&lt;br /&gt;
• Claims FIR registered against sitting senator over alleged tax evasion&lt;br /&gt;
• Says tobacco sector ‘not paying taxes’, involved in smuggling&lt;br /&gt;
• Construction relief package ‘in pipeline’, announcement expected soon&lt;br /&gt;
• Textile support under review; minister seeks 10-12 days for concrete steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb on Saturday warned that Pakistan could not be run with a rapidly increasing population and stressed that the private sector would have to take the lead and create employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If this growth rate (2.5pc) continues, our population can reach 400 million in the coming years. So, you tell us who will run this country in such a situation,” he said while speaking at the Pakistan Economic Growth Conference at the regional office of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Lahore. “So please help us on how to control the population,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On employment, the minister said the government alone could not provide jobs to the entire population of 250 million. “The private sector should lead the country’s economy and provide jobs,” he said, adding that the government’s role was to strengthen and enable the private sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister emphasised the need to adopt the strategy that Bangladesh had used to control its population. “When you talk about Bangladesh with reference to taxation, competitiveness, growth, etc, while comparing with Pakistan, why don’t you talk about its journey to control population,” he questioned, requesting the businesspersons to come forward and help the government reduce the population growth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aurangzeb said the government was making efforts to broaden the tax base, claiming that an FIR had been registered against a sitting senator over alleged tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tobacco and cigarette companies, except for two, are not paying taxes. They are also involved in smuggling. But we are not sparing them. We got an FIR even against a sitting senator,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the government had started monitoring sales tax on goods starting with the sugar industry and would move to other sectors in phases. “The PM has instructed us to start this from the sugar industry since his family is engaged in this [sugar] business,” Mr Aurangzeb claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finance minister said that after economic stabilisation, industrialisation was essential for sustainable growth and reiterated that the government was pursuing an export-led policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said relief measures for the construction sector were in the pipeline and would soon be announced by the prime minister, while support for the textile sector and possible reductions in taxes linked to the property sector were also under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said digitisation would improve transparency and revenue collection and acknowledged that the salaried class bore a disproportionate share of the tax burden. He reiterated the government’s commitment to providing relief to salaried individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting developments in the construction sector, the finance minister said the work was actively underway and efforts were being made to broaden the tax net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clarified that the real estate and construction sectors were being treated separately, adding that construction was linked with multiple allied industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He assured the business community that their issues would be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the textile sector, he said that its issues were currently under review and requested 10 to 12 more days, assuring that concrete steps would be announced shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further stated that the government was reviewing the possibility of reducing multiple taxes in the property sector while carefully balancing fiscal responsibilities with sectoral demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aurangzeb said that the positive impact of Pakistan’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has begun to materialise, restoring the confidence of international financial institutions in Pakistan’s economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the country was now firmly on the path of stability and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that difficult but necessary decisions were taken to ensure fiscal discipline, particularly when Pakistan faced the risk of default. While the 2022 floods severely affected the economy, he said the country had sufficient capacity to absorb the losses caused by the 2025 floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finance minister described IT exports as the future of Pakistan’s economy, stating that current IT exports stood at $3-4 billion, with the potential to reach $8-10bn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stressed that export proceeds must be fully repatriated, as a significant portion — around $4-5bn — was currently retained abroad. He further stated that foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan were increasing consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Due to prudent government policies, inflation has declined to record lows, providing tangible relief to the general public,” he said, reiterating that the salaried class would continue to receive priority relief measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, former minister Gohar Ejaz expressed concern over heavy taxation on real estate and other sectors, saying it was pushing investment abroad, particularly to Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pakistani people have already purchased properties worth $100bn in Dubai. A property expo for investment in Dubai is also being held in Lahore. And this city, after Karachi and other major cities, will be empty soon,” he deplored, requesting the government to reduce taxes on real estate and other sectors for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, living in exile, has branded the recent February 12 polls a 'pre-planned election of deception and farce.' She alleges widespread manipulation and unrealistic turnout figures. Meanwhile, her rival Khaleda Zia's party, the BNP, secured a significant victory, prompting calls for Hasina's extradition from India to face trial.</description>

      <description>Bangladesh Election: Sheikh Hasina has sharply rejected the results of Bangladesh's 13th National Parliamentary Election. She described the February 12 vote as a disgrace and a farce. Hasina alleged administrative manipulation and numerical fraud. She demanded the annulment of the election and the resignation of the interim administration. Hasina called for fresh elections under a neutral caretaker government to restore voting rights.</description>

      <title>T20 World Cup: India and Pakistan fans flock to Colombo, windfall for tourism. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972941/t20-world-cup-india-and-pakistan-fans-flock-to-colombo-windfall-for-tourism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prices of flights and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared as thousands of fans flock to the city to watch India play Pakistan on Sunday in cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighbouring countries and cricket rivals are due to meet during the group stage of the tournament, which is being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, after Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;reversed &lt;/a&gt;a decision to boycott the match earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game at Sri Lanka’s largest stadium is sold out with roughly 35,000 tickets sold, and ahead of the match, most hotels in Colombo have doubled their prices — the cost of a room has climbed as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the match was finalised this week, last-minute bookings led to fuller flights from major cities like Chennai and Delhi, according to three Colombo travel agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to around $623-$756, while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 per cent to roughly $666.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nalin Jayasundera, President of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), said hotels were booked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices,” Jayasundera said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, famous for its ancient temples, pristine beaches, and lush tea plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that hosting more sporting events could boost Sri Lanka’s economic growth, which is recovering from a severe financial crisis and a recent cyclone, which killed 650 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20pc of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island nation is hoping to position itself as a neutral venue for matches between political rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is clearly showing confidence in Sri Lanka as a neutral cricket venue. Whether it’s India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, this is a welcome message to all South Asian countries that they can play cricket in Sri Lanka,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s going to be a great experience, said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend who is flying in from New Zealand. I’m really excited about this match.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sultan added he thought Pakistan absolutely could come out on top on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He publicly supported Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami in the recent election. This move has reignited debates about his credibility. Critics question his understanding of complex political movements. His past controversies regarding fundraising and factual accuracy have resurfaced. The endorsement of Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party, has drawn significant backlash.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Destined to a perilous life with no right to an education or to vote, state recognition ‘gives them hope’, campaigners say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the decades that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/17/children-trapped-bangladesh-brothel-village-video?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot;&gt;the Daulatdia brothel&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh has existed, children born there have been invisible, unable to be registered because their mothers were sex workers and their fathers unknown. Now, for the first time, all 400 of them in the brothel village have their own birth certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That milestone was reached after a push by campaigners who have spent decades working with Bangladesh’s undocumented children born in brothels or on the street. It means they can finally access the rights afforded to other citizens: the ability to go to school, to be issued a passport or to vote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/feb/13/invisible-children-born-in-the-brothels-of-bangladesh-finally-get-birth-certificates&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>PM Shehbaz to attend inaugural Board of Peace meeting in US, confirms FO. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972727/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-inaugural-board-of-peace-meeting-in-us-confirms-fo</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi confirmed on Thursday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting in the US, saying that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would also accompany him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrabi’s confirmation follows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972442&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that said PM Shehbaz was expected to visit Washington on February 18 and represent Pakistan at the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, which is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” Andrabi said during a weekly briefing of the FO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that information about other members of Pakistan’s delegation and its engagements would be shared in due course of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked specifically whether Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir would be included in the delegation, the FO spokesperson reiterated: “We will share these details in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not have the details — neither on the itinerary, nor on the composition of the delegation. I can confirm that the prime minister will lead the delegation and that the deputy prime minister and foreign minister will be part of the delegation. This is the extent of information right now. We will, of course, update you in due course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is among the 14 countries that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968339&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; the charter of the Board of Peace on January 22 on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, becoming a founding member of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository. President Trump has designated the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the board’s headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November 2025 authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971789&quot;&gt;violations&lt;/a&gt; by Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Trump’s Gaza plan unveiled late last year, the Board of Peace was originally intended to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance following a ceasefire, before being expanded to address global conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rights experts and scholars have, however,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965054&quot;&gt; criticised the concept&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that a US-led board overseeing the affairs of a foreign territory resembles a colonial structure. The absence of Palestinian representation on the board has further deepened these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journalist also pointed out during the FO briefing on Thursday that there was no representation from Gaza on the board. Highlighting US support for Israel as well, the journalist asked: “How reliable would this Board of Peace prove to be for the people of Gaza?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his response, Andrabi said, “We have joined the Board of Peace in good faith, as I highlighted in my previous briefing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also pointed that Pakistan had not joined the board in isolation and not as “one voice, but as collective voice of eight Islamic-Arab countries”, which had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944220&quot;&gt;worked with Trump&lt;/a&gt; on his Gaza plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our collective voice is resonating in the Board of Peace, and we will continue to strive for the rights, peace and prosperity of the people of Palestine, aimed at the long-term solution of the Palestine issue — to create a state of Palestine, in accordance with the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, our engagement is both for short-term, medium-term and long-term solution of the plight of the Palestinian people,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972698/israel-has-joined-trumps-board-of-peace-netanyahu-says&quot;&gt;Israel joining the board&lt;/a&gt;, the FO spokesperson said: “It is their decision. We are not obliged to offer any comment. We will engage with the Board of Peace with positivity of intent, and as I said, our prime minister will attend the Board of Peace meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#shot-down-a-number-of-indian-rafale-jets&quot; id=&quot;shot-down-a-number-of-indian-rafale-jets&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Shot down a number of Indian Rafale jets’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrabi was also for clarification following Trump’s recent remarks that 10 aircraft were shot down during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509&quot;&gt;four-day conflict&lt;/a&gt; between India and Pakistan in May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 months, the US president has stated numerous times that aircraft were shot down during the conflict — albeit without specifying whose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially stating that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;five jets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were shot down, Trump gradually raised that number to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951783&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;seven in October&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953444&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;eight in November&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the question on Trump’s statement, the FO spokesperson said: “We have stated it previously, and I wish to reiterate it here that Pakistan is appreciative of the role of the United States during our 90-hour war with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The role of the United States was for peace, for prevention of war and prevention of violence. So, in that context, President Trump’s statements, previous statements, and these statements are all obviously welcomed and endorsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As regards the fighter planes: this is a matter of history,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Pakistan shot down “a number of Indian Rafale jets, and the evidence is all over — available internationally, corroborated by international reports, including by the manufacturers of these planes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This demonstrated that Pakistan was able to deter Indian aggression through conventional means. This is also an indicator for the future — any future Indian aggression would be dealt forthrightly and forcefully with all our resources,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#weaponisation-of-cricket-is-regrettable&quot; id=&quot;weaponisation-of-cricket-is-regrettable&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Weaponisation of cricket is regrettable’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the session, the FO spokesperson was asked whether Pakistan’s decision to play the T20 World Cup match against India after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;announcing &lt;/a&gt;an initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott &lt;/a&gt;was the consequence of back-channel cricket diplomacy between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Andrabi said: “Cricket is a game that we all love and we all cherish. We grew up playing this game. Weaponisation of cricket, politicisation of cricket is regrettable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that the government’s decision to not play against India “reflected the resolve of the government of Pakistan to not let cricket be weaponised and politicised”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our subsequent decision to play reflected our magnanimity, after the relevant cricket authorities realised that they had weaponised and politicised cricket, particularly weaponised against Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you are aware, the Bangladesh side and Sri Lankan side (host of this game) were in touch with our government and cricket board,” he highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the decision to play the game, is reflective of the magnanimity shown by our prime minister as a result of contacts made by the brotherly countries of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as well as by a realisation within the relevant authorities managing cricket internationally and in India, that weaponisation and politicisation of cricket is wrong, is unwarranted, and it defies the spirit of the beloved game of cricket that we all cherish,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh's Awami League has denounced the recent parliamentary election as a staged charade, asserting it violated democratic principles and the constitution. The party claims widespread voter apathy, intimidation, and ballot stuffing marred the process. They are demanding the election's annulment, the chief advisor's resignation, and fresh polls under a neutral government to reinstate citizens' voting rights.</description>

      <title>Why playing India is the smartest decision PCB has made in months. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972538/why-playing-india-is-the-smartest-decision-pcb-has-made-in-months</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In international cricket, principle is often loud, emotional and instantly gratifying. Strategy, on the other hand, is quieter, slower, and frequently misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;eventually agree to play India &lt;/a&gt;on February 15 falls squarely in the latter category, and despite the initial optics, it is the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic boycott call did what it needed to do early on. It created noise, unsettled the International Cricket Council (ICC), and earned Pakistan something it has been desperately short of in recent years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970749&quot;&gt;an ally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s open friction with the ICC and India over security, scheduling and governance issues suddenly aligned its interests with Pakistan’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials taking place in Lahore on Feb 8, 2026. &amp;mdash; Screengrab via PCB video&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/1116263346e940a.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alignment may be situational for now, but in a cricketing ecosystem where Pakistan often finds itself isolated, even a temporary ally matters. In what seemed like an emotional and loud drama initially, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has done something that suggests calculation rather than impulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s stance carried weight morally as it played its strongest card not for immediate self-benefit, but in visible solidarity with another board, one with far less financial leverage and political capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode also forced a conversation about power imbalance in world cricket and structural marginalisation of smaller boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match. It is a financial event, the economic engine that quietly funds the ICC&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/11163031a88a82b.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;standing with Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan positioned itself not as a lone dissenter, but as part of a broader discomfort within the “middle tier” of cricket nations. However, the PCB has bills to pay, and such symbolic gestures, regardless of their strength, are not going to balance the books, which is why deciding to play the India game is a strategic win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking the field on Sunday, Pakistan will avoid the twin disasters a boycott would have triggered: forfeiture of crucial match points and loss of ICC revenue. The former would not have hurt Pakistan competitively as much, given their record against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 times the two arch-rivals have faced each other in the shortest format, Pakistan have only won three, while India dominates with 13 victories. Instead, it was the huge potential loss of money that got the governing body quiver at Pakistan’s boycott call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s players walk back to the pavilion at the end of the Asia Cup 2025 T20 international cricket match against India at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai, the UAE on September 14. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/1116261263d8542.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match. It is a financial event, the economic engine that quietly funds the ICC’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India receives 38.5 per cent of the ICC’s revenue distribution in the current cycle, which is more than what the next six boards receive combined. Pakistan’s share hovers around five to six per cent. This disparity is not an accident; it reflects market gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian broadcast market alone drives the bulk of ICC media rights, a deal worth billions over a four-year cycle, which is the major source of revenue for the governing body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan celebrates after the dismissal of Netherlands&amp;rsquo; Max O&amp;rsquo;Dowd during the 2026 ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match between Pakistan and the Netherlands at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo on February 7. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/11162547c3c830c.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan celebrates after the dismissal of Netherlands’ Max O’Dowd during the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match between Pakistan and the Netherlands at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo on February 7. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite receiving the lion’s share, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)’s income doesn’t depend on the ICC, as its revenue is heavily dominated by the Indian Premier League (IPL) and bilateral series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, any financial loss to the ICC would not have impacted BCCI as strongly as it would have Pakistan and other cricket boards, whose incomes are heavily dependent on their ICC revenue share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason India-Pakistan contests are manufactured into every ICC tournament. They are the biggest television events in cricket, reportedly accounting for 20-30pc of a tournament’s total broadcast value in a single match. The marquee encounter does not fund India’s cricket at a large scale, but it subsidises the ecosystem in which Pakistan cricket survives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To risk that revenue for a dispute that was not even Pakistan’s own would have been strategically naive. Agreeing to play India also repairs and strengthens the PCB’s working relationship with other boards, particularly Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/in-phone-call-with-pm-sri-lanka-president-urges-pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india&quot;&gt;strongly requested&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to call off its boycott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are boards that Pakistan has often relied on for neutral venues, logistical cooperation and political support within ICC committees. A unilateral boycott would have made Pakistan appear rigid, pushing it further to the margins at a time when it needs quiet diplomacy, not loud isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, even the ICC has been accommodating towards the PCB, bending significantly by agreeing to a hybrid hosting model to ensure that Pakistan does not have to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing the governing body further, especially when Pakistan lacks the financial muscle to challenge it head-on, would have been a dangerous escalation. The larger context is bleak, as the ICC is effectively run by India. This is not a conspiracy, but an economic reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s billion-plus market dictates broadcast value, sponsorship interest and administrative power. Complaining about reality without a long-term counter strategy is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While boycotts feel defiant, the harsh reality is that they change nothing. Pakistan currently does not possess the commercial influence or on-field dominance required to force systemic change. That does not mean it should abandon principle altogether, but it must choose its battles wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By taking a firm stance and then agreeing to play, the PCB has extracted narrative value without incurring material loss. It has shown that it can push back, but also that it understands its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sport that is increasingly governed by realpolitik, that balance matters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rawalpindi secures pacer Naseem Shah for Rs86.5m as bidding on fast bowlers concludes at PSL 11 auction in Lahore. [ dawn ]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is underway in Lahore, with fast bowler Naseem Shah sold to Rawalpindi for Rs86.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight franchises have started bidding on spinners, following the conclusion of the previous round, which saw wicket-keepers being auctioned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi spinner Rishaad Hossain was sold to Rawalpindi for a bid of Rs30m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up were Mamoon Imtiaz, Ali Majid, Momin Qamar, Peter Hatzoglou, and Arif Yaqoob, who did not receive any bids. Faisal Akram was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for the final bid of Rs12.5m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African batsman Rilee Rossouw was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for Rs55m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs11m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-rounders Hussain Talat, Asif Afridi, Danish Aziz, and Muhammad Zeeshan at the base price of Rs11m received no bids as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is currently underway in Lahore, with the eight franchises bidding on batsmen following the conclusion of the first round, which saw all-rounders auctioned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Indian cricketer Abhishek Sharma hospitalised ahead of T20 World Cup game with Namibia. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972514/indian-cricketer-abhishek-sharma-hospitalised-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-game-with-namibia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prolific Indian opener Abhishek Sharma has been hospitalised with an upset stomach ahead of the group match against Namibia at the T20 World Cup, a cricket board official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive left-hander is key to India’s chances of defending their title at the 20-team tournament and is doubtful for the Group A fixture on Thursday in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old was admitted to a Delhi hospital on Tuesday after he missed training with a stomach issue he carried from the opener in Mumbai, the official told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate acknowledged the concern on Tuesday, saying the batsman had “still got a few issues with his tummy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope that he’ll be available for the game in a few days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhishek was out for a duck in India’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971699/suryakumars-unbeaten-84-rescues-india-against-usa-in-t20-world-cup&quot;&gt;win over the United States&lt;/a&gt; but has been a strong performer in the lead-up to the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; arch-rivals Pakistan in a blockbuster on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Pakistani government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it was withdrawing its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decision to boycott&lt;/a&gt; the match with India, which had been taken previously in the wake of Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to tour India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to move forward with the much-anticipated game came after protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;negotiations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the ICC and the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consultations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders, and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972510/us-trade-office-removes-controversial-map-of-india-from-social-media-after-pakistan-protests</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map, which accompanied a USTR press release announcing a framework for an interim US-India trade agreement, showed the entire Jammu and Kashmir region — including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan — within Indian boundaries. It also depicted China’s Aksai Chin region as part of India, despite the fact that the area is claimed by China and remains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1772898&quot;&gt;disputed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971369&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970640&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227&quot;&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh's recent trade agreement with the United States appears to be a double-edged sword for its garment industry. Although it provides zero-duty access, the stipulation to use US-sourced cotton and fibers undermines their competitive edge, given their current dependence on alternative suppliers. Additionally, the obligation to import US agricultural products and energy adds financial strain.</description>

      <title>Bangladeshi woman moves Lahore High Court against ‘unjustified’ offloading by FIA. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972401/bangladeshi-woman-moves-lahore-high-court-against-unjustified-offloading-by-fia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: An elderly woman, who was allegedly born in Bangladesh and was trafficked and sold in Pakistan some 35 years ago, has approached the Lahore High Court against the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for offloading her from a Dhaka-bound flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Razia Bibi, 58, filed a petition through her counsel, Ali Changezi Sandhu, and also sought imposition of a fine on the FIA for offloading her, allegedly without any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the petition, the counsel alleged that the petitioner was kidnapped in Bangladesh and illegally brought to Pakistan, where she was sold in Karachi some 35 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner was forced into marriage with her ‘purchaser’ in Pakistan and later shifted to Kasur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the petitioner, who is now a Pakistani citizen, recently reconnected with her Bangladeshi family through social media and her mother pleaded to meet her one last time in her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer stated when the petitioner, on Feb 27, 2025, reached the Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore, to travel to Bangladesh, the FIA immigration staff offloaded her without providing any justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner filed an application with the interior ministry for action against the “unlawful” act of the FIA officials, but to no avail so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argued that on the basis of mere suspicion and assumptions regarding illegal travel and human smuggling, thousands of Pakistani youths had been falling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961655&quot;&gt;victim&lt;/a&gt; to the FIA’s “unlawful offloading”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, offloading an elderly woman without any reason clearly indicates that the FIA engages in illegal practices, the counsel alleged, and sought an order for the agency to compensate the petitioner for the amount she spent on her air ticket and visa fee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sensible decision. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972476/sensible-decision</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER days-long negotiations, Pakistan moved for the greater good of world cricket when its government gave the national cricket team the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;go-ahead&lt;/a&gt; to play their Twenty20 World Cup match against India on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play the blockbuster fixture, which is the revenue generator for the International Cricket Council, after Scotland had been drafted in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh at the World Cup following the latter country’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for their matches due to security concerns. The Pakistan Cricket Board had protested the decision of the India-led ICC. While the team was allowed to travel to the tournament it was instructed to forfeit the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its finances in danger, the ICC came to the table with its director Imran Khawaja flying to Pakistan over the weekend. Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Aminul Islam also arrived, with Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi at the centre of negotiations. Pakistan had already been requested by Sri Lanka, where the national team is playing their matches of the World Cup, and the UAE to reconsider their decision. The PCB, however, was fighting a bigger battle: to ensure equality in world cricket against the governing body that has for long acted on India’s whims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, it has succeeded. The ICC has not penalised Bangladesh, while also granting it hosting rights for a tournament in the 2028-2031 cycle to mitigate the impact from its ouster from the World Cup. It therefore made sense for Pakistan to change their stance; going ahead with the World Cup match against India means ensuring financial security for the cricket world, especially the associate members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should not be forgotten. It should also mark the start of a new era in cricket governance. The politicisation of the sport has been a menace that has hindered the growth of the game for long. Sports should not be used as a propagation of political messaging and it is high time this practice was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the arrangement between Pakistan and India, which sees both sides play their matches of an event in either country at neutral venues, ends, the ICC should look to ensuring that it normalises bilateral cricketing ties between the two arch-rivals. That would embellish the ICC’s legitimacy as a neutral body that is focused on making sure that the game stays above petty politicking.&lt;/p&gt;

She also notes that Bangladesh's access to US markets is tied to sourcing materials like yarn and cotton from the USA. India already supplies these competitively and quickly.</description>

      <title>Over 150,000 cops to guard ‘risky’ polling stations in Bangladesh. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972439/over-150000-cops-to-guard-risky-polling-stations-in-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s police chief said on Tuesday that more than 150,000 officers will be deployed for this week’s elections, warning that more than half of polling stations were flagged as vulnerable to violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that five people were killed and more than 600 injured in political clashes during the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972185&quot;&gt; campaign&lt;/a&gt; period from Dec 11 to Feb 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 157,000 police officers, backed by 100,000 soldiers and other security forces, will guard Thursday’s vote — the first since a mass uprising toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are 1,000 per cent confident about doing our part,” Inspector General of Police Baharul Alam told reporters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman warns of ‘huge’ challenges ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country of 170 million has remained in political turmoil since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; against Hasina, when police carried out a deadly crackdown during her failed bid to cling to power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alam said police had assessed that “more than 24,000 polling centres have been marked as either high-risk or moderately risky” for possible unrest, violence or ballot stuffing — more than half of the 42,000 centres nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The location of some centres is very remote, and there is intense competition, and hostility among candidates and their supporters,” he said, adding that 1,300 police guns looted during the 2024 unrest have still not been recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In high-risk and moderately risky centres, police will carry out patrol duty with body-worn cameras for the first time,” Alam said. He added that police were determined to ensure the polls were peaceful, but said he accepted that distrust of his force remained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is quite understandable why people do not trust the police,” he said, adding: “Over the last 15 ye­­a­rs, based on what we have delivered — in fact, for the last 150 years, our predecessors mostly beat people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bangla­de­sh’s leading prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman said on Tuesday he faces “huge” challenges if he wins elections this week, vowing to repair a country he said was looted under the previous ousted government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to ensure a normal situation in the country, so that people are safe,” Rahman told &lt;em&gt;AFP.&lt;/em&gt; But he warned the task ahead would be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EU parliament adopts twin texts hardening migration policy. [ dawn ]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRASBOURG: The European Parliament on Tuesday definitively adopted two flagship texts tightening EU migration policy, championed by an alliance of right-wing and far-right lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is seeking to make it easier for its 27 member states to send asylum seekers to countries they did not come from but that Europe deems “safe”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has sought to test the concept with centres in Albania. The migrant centres have, however, largely stood empty since being opened in 2024 because of legal challenges, with many Italian judges viewing the scheme as unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the EU measures adopted on Tuesday is expected to facilitate this approach, to the dismay of human rights advocates and left-wing groups, who warn about the treatment asylum seekers may face in such countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green MEP Melissa Camara called it “another step in the dehumanisation of the European Union’s migration policy,” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;charging that the dignity of asylum seekers was being “trampled” on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission rejects the criticism, insisting that any country receiving migrants under the scheme must respect fundamental rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key measure approved by parliament is the creation of a list of countries the EU considers “safe” — effectively limiting asylum prospects for their nationals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list, which includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia, is intended to speed up the processing of asylum claims and, where appropriate, accelerate returns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Citizens expect us to deliver on our promises regarding migration policy, and that is exactly what we are doing today,” conservative lawmaker Lena Dupont told the assembly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s political centre of gravity has shifted firmly right in recent years, and a decline in irregular entries — down around 25 per cent in 2025 compared to 2024 — has not eased the political pressure to act on the hot-button issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly one million people applied for asylum in the EU last year and about 440,000 were granted protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Information adviser Shafiqul Alam says the U.S.-Bangladesh trade deal inked on Monday is a ‘game changer’ that can further open up the U.S. market for Bangladesh. In April 2025, Bangladesh restricted yarn imports from India through its land ports after bilateral ties soured. In May 2025, India imposed curbs on imports of readymade garments and other items from Bangladesh through land ports.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;JF-17&lt;/a&gt; Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967005&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024. Azerbaijan had become the third country to acquire JF-17 fighters after Myanmar and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

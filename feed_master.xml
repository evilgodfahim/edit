      <title>Labour red-faced, Reform cries foul as Greens claim key by-poll. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1976299/labour-red-faced-reform-cries-foul-as-greens-claim-key-by-poll</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-4/5  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;  A SCREENSHOT from the Greens&amp;rsquo; Urdu language campaign video.  &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/69a235c67aee2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;A SCREENSHOT from the Greens’ Urdu language campaign video.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON: The Green Party of England and Wales secured a landmark victory in the Gorton and Denton by-election, overturning Labour’s 13,000-vote majority in a result that comes as a significant setback to Keir Starmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannah Spencer, a local plumber and Green councillor, was elected as the party’s first MP in northern England after winning 14,980 votes in a tightly contested race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reform UK came second with 10,578 votes, while Labour slumped to third place, finishing 5,616 votes behind the Greens, a dramatic 25.3 per cent drop in its vote share compared with 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starmer, facing mounting questions over Labour’s campaign strategy, vowed to “keep on fighting” after what party insiders described as a humiliating defeat in a constituency long considered a Labour stronghold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilingual campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to Spencer’s campaign was an unprecedented multilingual outreach effort aimed at engaging Gorton and Denton’s diverse electorate. The Greens released campaign pamphlets and a video in Urdu, and later in Bangla, highlighting issues such as inflation, unemployment and the housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Councillor Hannah Spencer wins on the back of unique campaign which used Urdu and Bangla to spread her message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Urdu language video, Spencer is seen visiting local businesses and addressing voters directly in Urdu. Over images of Starmer shaking hands with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Secretary David Lammy meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Spencer says: “Politicians aren’t working for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The references were widely interpreted as an attempt to appeal to Muslim voters, who make up 28.4pc of the constituency, while 26.6pc of residents identify as Asian. Although there is no official breakdown of Urdu speakers in the constituency, it is considered one of the more diverse areas in England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer defended the strategy, saying it reflected the constituency’s linguistic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gorton and Denton is a beautifully diverse constituency, with thousands of residents who speak languages other than English,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m proud of our campaign, and of this video, which has been positive, inclusive and focused on the issues that matter most to local people: bringing down rents and bills, proper investment in public services, and rebuilding our NHS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rivals cry foul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multilingual materials triggered sharp criticism from Labour and Reform UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell accused the Greens of a “shameful attempt to manipulate the respected Muslim community,” while a senior Cabinet minister told &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; that the party was “deliberately raising the salience of Gaza” to erode Labour’s support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reform UK candidate Matt Goodwin described the Urdu language video as “blatant sectarianism,” and Reform MP Sarah Pochin released a video condemning the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greens rejected the accusations and doubled down by issuing a similar campaign advert in Bangla, the national language of Bangladesh. Spencer accused Labour of resorting to “racist dog whistles” and insisted that providing materials in languages other than English was about inclusion, not division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will be an MP for the whole of Gorton and Denton,” she said, “and I’m proud that we’re demonstrating that by speaking to constituents in the languages they speak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landmark win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The by-election result marks one of the most significant Green breakthroughs outside London and Brighton, raising questions about Labour’s grip on urban, ethnically diverse constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Starmer, who had pledged to rebuild Labour’s electoral coalition, the loss is a stark warning that disaffection among key voter groups could reshape the political landscape ahead of the next general election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Greens, meanwhile, the victory signals a new phase of ambition and a willingness to adopt bold and targeted campaigning in pursuit of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columnist Taj Ali, writing for Hyphen noted that the Green victory in Gorton and Denton proves working-class and Muslim voters have options.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The real problem is not the use of AI itself. The problem is that writing classes have often focused too much on the finished essay and not enough on the thinking behind it.</description>

      <title>Pybus embraces move to Afghanistan as new head coach. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1976002/pybus-embraces-move-to-afghanistan-as-new-head-coach</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LONDON: Richard Pybus said he had no issues with moving to Afghanistan to take over as head coach of the national cricket team following Jonathan Trott’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953039&quot;&gt;departure &lt;/a&gt;last week at the end of their Twenty20 World Cup campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket has yet to resume in Afghanistan due to the political situation and the national side play their home fixtures in the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous foreign coaches were based outside the country and typically joined the squad during training camps in the UAE or India before international tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Afghanistan’s board (ACB) chief Naseeb Khan told cricket news website Cricbuzz last week that they wanted the new coach and support staff to be based in the country to work more closely with domestic players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve lived in lots of different parts of the world and so I am fine with it,” England-born Pybus, 61, told Cricbuzz. “I’m looking forward to getting out into the provinces and being able to scout players and work with the selectors and get busy on the development of the players…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The side’s really developed over a period of time so, as we would have seen at the last couple of World Cups, they’re a really serious cricket team now and so yeah, very excited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pybus, who previously had coaching stints with West Indies, Pakistan and Bangladesh, will begin his role by preparing the team for a limited-overs series against Sri Lanka in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teams will play three Twenty20s in Sharjah and three One-day Internationals in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Published in Dawn, February 27th, 2026&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.38;&quot;&gt;A Bangladeshi court has ordered the issuance of an Interpol red notice for the arrest of Tulip Siddiq, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk&quot;&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; lawmaker, over corruption charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Sabbir Foyez, a senior judge in Dhaka, issued the order on Thursday following an application from the country’s anti-corruption commission, local media reported.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siddiq is the Labour member of parliament for Hampstead and Highgate in London, and a former Treasury minister.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also the niece of Sheikh Hasina, the former longtime prime minister of Bangladesh whose government was overthrown by a mass student-led uprising in August 2024.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-corruption commission said that Siddiq used her family connections with Hasina to influence the awarding of land in the upmarket Gulshan area of the Bangladeshi capital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siddiq has been sentenced to a total of six years in jail in absentia in three other corruption cases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She rejects all allegations against her, and previously described proceedings against her as “flawed and farcical from beginning to end”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle East Eye has reached out to her for comment on the Interpol red notice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Corruption allegations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Labour previously told MEE: “As has been reported, highly regarded senior legal professionals have highlighted that Tulip Siddiq has not had access to a fair legal process in this case and has never been informed of the details of the charges against her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said that despite repeated requests, her legal team was not able to make representations when allegations were brought against her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Given that has not happened in this case, we cannot recognise this judgement,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siddiq resigned from her post as Treasury minister in January 2025 amid the corruption allegations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said at the time that she had been cleared of wrongdoing but that the issue had become a “distraction from the work of the government”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siddiq’s aunt Hasina has been in exile in India since her overthrow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days after her government was toppled, Mohammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace laureate, took charge as interim leader of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, a court sentenced Hasina to death in absentia over crimes against humanity for ordering a deadly crackdown on student-led protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her second stint as prime minister, from 2009 until 2024, was marred by arrests of political opponents, the silencing of dissenting voices and accusations of human rights abuses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Bangladeshi National Party (BNP) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/bnp-wins-majority-first-free-and-fair-bangladesh-election-two-decades&quot;&gt;decisively won&lt;/a&gt; what was considered Bangladesh’s first free and fair general election in nearly two decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman - the son of Khaleda Zia, the former prime minister, and Ziaur Rahman, the assassinated former president - was sworn in as the new premier on 17 February.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Israel committed two-thirds of record press killings in 2025: CPJ. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1975665/israel-committed-two-thirds-of-record-press-killings-in-2025-cpj</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A record 129 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide in 2025, the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Wednesday, blaming Israel for two-thirds of the deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the second consecutive annual record for press deaths and the deadliest year since the CPJ began collecting data more than three decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Journalists are being killed in record numbers at a time when access to information is more important than ever,” CEO Jodie Ginsberg said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are all at risk when journalists are killed for reporting the news.” Over three-quarters of all the fatalities in 2025 were in conflict settings, the CPJ said in its report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 60 per cent of the 86 members of the press killed by Israeli fire in 2025 were Palestinians reporting from Gaza, it added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli military claims that it never “deliberately targets” journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of journalists killed in Ukraine and Sudan also increased in 2025 compared to the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPJ highlighted a rise in drones being used, with 39 cases documented, including 28 killings by Israel in Gaza and five by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, four journalists were killed by Russian military drones, the highest annual number of journalist deaths in the war since 15 were killed in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists are increasingly vulnerable due to a persistent culture of impunity, the CPJ said, noting a lack of transparent investigations into killings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mexico, six journalists were killed in 2025, and all the cases remain unsolved. The Philippines saw three journalists shot dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others were killed following their reporting on corruption, such as a Bangladeshi reporter hacked to death by suspects linked to a fraud ring, according to the CPJ report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar organised crime-related deaths were recorded in India and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Saudi Arabia, prominent columnist Turki al-Jasser was executed by the state after being convicted on several charges that the CPJ likened to “spurious national security and financial crime allegations” used to punish reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Gulf state’s first documented killing of a journalist since the 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1523929&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Jamal Khashoggi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The agreement does, however, offer one significant benefit: Bangladeshi garments made with US cotton and man-made fibre would get zero tariffs in the US market.</description>

      <title>Trade gap widens 42pc with nine countries to $9bn. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1975357/trade-gap-widens-42pc-with-nine-countries-to-9bn</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s trade deficit with nine regional countries swelled by 41.37 per cent to $9.001 billion in the first seven months (July-January) of FY26, up from $6.367bn in the corresponding period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widening gap reflects a fall in Pakistan’s exports to regional markets, driven largely by reduced shipments to China, followed by Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Trade with Afghanistan, including exports, has remained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964233&quot;&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; since October 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to India posted a slight increase in percentage terms, though the rise was minimal in dollar value. Meanwhile, shipments to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka declined during the period under review, according to the latest figures &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sbp.org.pk/publications/export/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by the State Bank of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade deficit with the nine countries widened by 29.42pc to $12.297bn in FY25 compared to $9.502bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of Pakistan’s exports to the nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — declined by 16.86pc to $2.307bn in 7MFY26 compared to $2.775bn a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FY25, exports to these nine countries recorded a modest increase of 1.49 per cent, rising to $4.401 billion in July to June, up from $4.336 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to this, imports surged 23.69pc to $11.31bn in 7MFY26 from $9.14bn. Imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 24.58pc to $11.097bn in 7MFY26 from $8.907bn over the same period last year. In FY25, imports from China stood at $16.312bn, up by 20.79pc from $13.504bn a year ago. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s exports to China fell by 1.02pc to $1.467bn in 7MFY26 from $1.482bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports from India dipped by 9.44pc to $122.56m in 7MFY26 from $135.35m. In FY25, import from New Delhi increased to $220.58m from $206.89m in the preceding year. Meanwhile, exports remained at $2.926m, slightly increased from $0.404m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Afghanistan dipped 59.07pc to $228.96m in 7MFY26 from $559.52m last year. Imports stood at $6.36m in 7MFY26 against $15.21m in FY25, a plunge of 58.18pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s exports to Bangladesh declined by 10.48pc to $417.62m in 7MFY26 from $466.55m over the last year. In FY25, exports to Dhaka increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m from $661.19m. Imports grew 14.02pc to $42.17m in 7MFY26 from $49.05m over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 28.89pc to $184.48m in 7MFY26 from $259.43m over the last year. The imports from Sri Lanka rose by 11.63pc $38.57m in 7MFY26 from $34.55m over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>South Africa announce eight home Tests for 2026-27. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1975314/south-africa-announce-eight-home-tests-for-2026-27</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CENTURION: World champions South Africa will play eight Test matches at home in the 2026-27 season, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa, who beat Australia in the 2023-25 Test championship final at Lord’s in England last year, did not play a single home Test match during the current 2025-26 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they will play three Tests against Australia, two against Bangladesh and three against England in the coming season with all three series counting towards the 2025-27 World Test Championship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa are currently in third place in the standings after sharing a series 1-1 in Pakistan and beating India 2-0 in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tests against Australia will all be at coastal venues — Durban, Gqeberha and Cape Town — starting on Oct 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh series will be played in Johannesburg and Centurion during November, while England will be the visitors over the holiday period of December-January. The England Tests will be in Johannesburg, Centurion and Cape Town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three tours will also include three-match One-day Internationals series, while Bangladesh will also play three T20 Internationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;England were also due to play a T20 series but it will be rescheduled because of a clash with the SA20 franchise competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSA chief executive Pholetsi Moseki said the Test and ODI series were both particularly important for the South African team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have made a promising start to the new World Test Championship cycle and it is important that we continue to build on that momentum and strengthen our position on the WTC table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On the white-ball front, our focus remains firmly on building towards hosting the ICC men’s Cricket World Cup in 2027. Every ODI series from here forms part of our preparation for that global event.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s home fixtures (2026-27):&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OICCI seeks to break ‘tax paradox’. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974914/oicci-seeks-to-break-tax-paradox</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has urged the government to immediately freeze all preferential tax treatments — including new exemptions, zero-rating and special regimes — whether introduced through SROs or legislation, unless routed through a fully operational Tax Policy Office (TPO) with a published rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a special report titled Pakistan’s Tax Paradox, the OICCI describes Pakistan’s tax system as one characterised by a narrow tax base and high tax rates, with tax revenues remaining largely stagnant as a share of GDP despite growth in absolute collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It notes that Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio has remained between 9 and 10 per cent for over a decade, although reforms have recently pushed it into double digits, reaching 10.3pc in FY25.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this remains well below international benchmarks. According to the World Bank and the IMF, a tax-to-GDP ratio exceeding 15pc is essential for sustainable growth, poverty reduction and the provision of basic public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report highlights that OECD countries collect taxes equivalent to 34pc of GDP, while the Asia-Pacific average stands at 19.3pc. Pakistan lags behind regional peers such as India (17pc) and Bangladesh (12pc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OICCI recommends that Pakistan’s tax reform agenda be guided by clear outcome targets and disciplined sequencing. It proposes raising the tax-to-GDP ratio from the current 10-12pc range to around 13pc in the short term and above 15pc in the medium term to support growth, strengthen fiscal stability and reduce reliance on debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among its key recommendations, the report calls for immediate operationalisation of the Tax Policy Office as a gatekeeper for all tax changes, along with a clear separation of tax policy from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)’s administrative functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also proposes freezing all preferential treatments, removing arbitrary forms of taxation to minimise refund issues, implementing a structured refund clearance plan, starting with refund-heavy sectors, and adopting a consultative approach in designing and reviewing tax regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also recommends eliminating the super tax under Sections 4B and 4C, reducing the corporate tax rate to 28pc, cutting withholding taxes to 5pc and fixing the maximum salary tax slab at 25pc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asian Development Bank to support AI adoption in Pakistan’s health sector. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974906/asian-development-bank-to-support-ai-adoption-in-pakistans-health-sector</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank will provide technical assistance to Pakistan to enhance understanding and accelerate the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADB has approved regional technical assistance amounting to $950,000 to help Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia reap the benefits of AI for service excellence in health. The assistance will assess AI applications in health promotion, screening, diagnosis, and treatment, and will develop a roadmap for AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governments benefiting from the assistance have requested the ADB to help develop practical AI governance frameworks for anticipated AI innovations, including validation mechanisms, ways to safeguard data privacy and avoid algorithmic bias, and strategies for post-market performance monitoring. These countries are also keen to learn from best practices and use cases for AI tools in clinical care and health management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the ADB had supported member countries investing in digital health, helping them adopt digital health information systems, establish common standards, and improve interoperability, thereby laying a strong foundation for big data analytics and AI applications. The assistance will provide timely support to enhance the AI readiness of member countries’ health systems through technical support and capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bank’s project to assess AI applications in health promotion, screening, diagnosis and treatment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the project document, the assistance will focus on three types of AI applications that are relevant for ADB projects and are becoming mature. First, applications in the clinical context, including AI-assisted smart point-of-care diagnosis and treatment. Advances in image processing and pattern recognition allow medical equipment to become “smart” enough to generate highly accurate diagnoses at the point of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, AI applications in healthcare management aim to improve efficiency and the experience of both patients and health workers. Small hospitals can adopt AI solutions to provide a seamless experience for patients — from appointments, registration, consultations, prescriptions, and treatment to follow-ups — and to help manage patient flow. AI could also automate administrative tasks for health professionals and managers, freeing up time for patient care, improving doctor-patient interaction, and preventing burnout, which is common among health professionals in primary care and hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, generative AI and AI agents could assist in distance learning, medical education, and telemedicine, providing clinical decision support for areas and populations with limited physical access. This could significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of medical education, upskilling of health workers, and public health education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the project document, AI applications have the potential to transform health service organisation and delivery. They could improve the efficiency, quality, and equitable access to healthcare services. AI leveraging big data analytics, deep learning, natural language processing, and robotics could enhance health management, diagnostics, and treatment capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technologies also open new possibilities in rapid drug discovery and personalised medicine. AI can automate record-keeping, claims monitoring, and other administrative tasks; reduce health worker burnout; and enhance efficiency, transparency, and quality of patient-doctor interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical assistance will deliver knowledge to inform the design and implementation of ADB projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan. It will survey available AI tools in healthcare and help member countries develop roadmaps for home-grown AI ecosystems that integrate considerations for research and development, technology transfer, commercialization, and procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADB notes that intensified geopolitics, economic uncertainties, and major shifts in the global health aid landscape have constrained the investments needed to improve health outcomes. Governments continue to face gaps in health infrastructure, equipment bottlenecks, mal-distribution of qualified health human resources, insufficient funding to upskill and incentivise health workers, escalating health expenditure, and the proliferation of fragmented and non-interoperable digital health applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Absorbing population growth. [ dawn ]</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974737/absorbing-population-growth</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;FINALLY, the debate about whether rapid population growth is beneficial or pernicious for the economy appears to be settled. While the evidence was extensive and categorical, it has taken several decades for the numbers to be absorbed by our leading economists. In the meantime, we have potentially lost billions of dollars in GDP, experienced the tragedy of several thousand maternal and child deaths, and seen a decline in per capita income as the cost of not pursuing sound population policies and actions to bring down our rapid population growth rate. While all our neighbours, most prominently Bangladesh, took clear and purposeful steps, we have complacently accepted high and even rising population growth rates since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus created at DawnMedia’s &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUNr-LEZxTWbD3UcLWdAvL5EHJZFrRWFCTRsF-4UGt4/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paki­stan Population Summit&lt;/a&gt; last December confirmed several truths. First and foremost is that economic growth and prosperity for Pakistan are impossible under current demographic trends. High fertility and population growth rates are eating into an already low economic growth, resulting in greater poverty and income inequalities. There is categorical evidence that larger households with more dependents save less, spend less on education and eat lower-quality food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the expectation of a demographic dividend due to the surge in the working population is an elusive dream. In fact, this dream has been shattered by growing unemployment figures and a rising gap in the ability to generate employment to keep up with the millions of youth entering the labour force each year. The finance minister has publicly admitted that it is next to impossible, as not enough jobs are being generated to keep pace with the forecasted surge in the working-age population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it was proclaimed that urbanisation would be the engine of growth and generate employment. However, it has been pointed out by &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org/topics_population-policy/21/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pakistan@2050&lt;/a&gt; that structural changes are required to produce more jobs. Rapid urbanisation is being led by a push out of agriculture in rural areas to escape poverty, and not as a pull factor in search of better jobs. In fact, additional jobs in new sectors only provide minimal employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit brought together a wide spectrum of participants and speakers, generating some optimism that we have turned the corner on population issues. Foremost, a media house took the initiative of organising a summit on population. Another prominent media house has just launched the Waqfa campaign to raise awareness and change behaviour. Much of this positivity is the outcome of the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nam-Fw4f8AxJWOwIVBdqGPfl0GafIDG7/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Council of Islamic Ideology&lt;/a&gt; and Population Council consultation on the concept of tawazun (balance) and birth spacing last year. This declaration has been endorsed by 37 prominent ulema supporting family planning and birth spacing for improved outcomes for mothers, children and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations of a demographic dividend due to the surge in working numbers are misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hopeful sign is the unusual cross-party support for the national issue of tackling high population growth rates. The Parliamentary Forum for Population has had successful meetings over five years, discussing resource-sharing around population. Forum members passed a unanimous &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmdk7nFLzPSUU6Dk-gVa0oFkjrBu3926/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; in parliament last August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a consensus has emerged, why is there very little action at the national or provincial level that reflects a commitment to lowering population growth on an urgent and priority basis? This is not to undermine efforts and statements issued periodically by the provincial and federal leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to act is immediate. There is no time for piecemeal efforts or waiting for the provinces to reach the same level of capacity and concern regarding this daunting challenge. The federal government should take the first step and become the dominant partner. It must demonstrate intent, moving beyond statements: theirs should be a policy setting and coordination role with the provinces and regions. Larger provinces, such as Punjab and Sindh, can generate their initiatives, but less-resourced provinces and regions definitely require supplemental funds from the centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finance minister has been most consistent and prominent in publicly expressing that population growth is not just an impediment but an existential crisis for Pakistan. Creating the financing and resources to balance population concerns, especially in the most challenging, poorest, remotest and vulnerable parts of the country, must be his ministry’s priority. Direct financing for districts that are most vulnerable and lack the basics, preventing millions of households from accessing education, health and family planning, has to become as much of a priority as other financing reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Benazir Income Support Programme is renowned as one of the largest social protection programmes in the world. It is centred on women. Unwanted pregnancies affect the poorest women most directly, as do unwanted and mistimed births, which are not within their control. A cash transfer programme must be launched that enables poorer households to access family planning services. This programme would follow the same rationale as providing income support to women living in the poorest households through BISP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poorest women, when able to fulfil their unmet needs, will provide for improved health outcomes for families and create an economically powerful impetus for improving household welfare. It will present a programme that enables millions to benefit from improving other outcomes — such as their own health, household savings and children’s investments — and trigger a new turnaround dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the federal government must activate and announce the CCI mandated population fund. This population fund should be well-resourced and function under the finance ministry; it would be used to award grants to provinces and regions for additional family planning services. Grants can be directly linked with performance in improving health and related outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a growing consensus that population concerns will not be solved without improving educational outcomes, particularly for women and girls. The most powerful way of empowering women is through education and skills, but especially through paid work, by ensuring their safety, mobility and employability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is heartening that the public conversation has shifted towards putting women in the driving seat. It is high time that women’s empowerment is seen as a solution to unlocking greater economic growth by tapping into work and earnings potential and reaping the benefits of increased household savings and positive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
